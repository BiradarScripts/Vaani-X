Do we have to stay quiet and invest till then? They don't get the motivation to grow the crops in a short period of time What do you say to this? You have asked a very good question Sir, we have to stay quiet for 12 years What I am saying is I am from the Bundwal of Shunya You can take any crop you want to grow there The government is providing the same crop The government is providing the same crop for your crop They are the ones who provide the crop They provide the crop for maintenance After planting the crop, there will be a water supply For the supply of water, you need to make small amounts I am saying that If you are going to the market to harvest the crops If you are going for 20 rupees, they will buy the crop for 2 rupees If you harvest the crop for 2 rupees, it will cost you 1 lakh rupees I am saying that You should do marketing as a scientist When you do marketing, you will look like a beast If you don't do marketing, you will fail in many crops If you do farming, you will fail If you are going to grow the tomatoes for 5 rupees They will sell it for 40 rupees We are going to grow the crops That is why we are saying We farmers should build a market That is why the government is doing this Start FPO's Start farmers producing organizations People are not getting awareness Start it Start marketing methods There are many popular media Start from one of the media You will get marketing That is why I am saying You should do the ironing method Every ironing method has different types of trees If you leave 4-5 trees in it we can grow some kinds of produce A few items, I Technology is stone Do you think those can grow 1 tree? It can grow anything Trees can not grow anything Dung can not grow Wood can not grow被res can not grow or you can make it into a manis or you can make it into a yelakki we can do such kind of science or you can make a tree and make it into a tree trunk and if 2-3 people cut it it will grow well and you can grow other plants so from this the tree will grow and you can grow more plants this is called science people don't know that we have made a tree but nothing happens below we have made a tree and there is another science we have made a tree 12 feet long actually this is not the real method we have to make a tree 12 feet long why 12 feet long because I make a tree 23 times a year in order to make a tree the next plant will grow and grow now I have made a tree between two trees I have made a host for the tree and made a mulberry now I have made a tree and it will grow slowly now it has grown to 16 lakhs now it has grown to 16 lakhs now it has grown to 16 lakhs how many lakhs will it be we don't need to check it we have a seed I have a stem if you give a stem to a stone for what purpose for wood or plywood sheet minimum 10 will be 5000 if you say that the mulberry will die it will be 4000 if you say that the seed will die it will be 5000 if you say that it will die it will be 50000 if it dies it will be 50000 lakhs it will be 50000 lakhs at one time it will be a hum on at one time it will be a hum on at one time it will be a hum on our youth our people we have to be careful at night we have to take our car at night in this concept in agriculture you have to keep everything don't keep only one tree missile or this there is something to give to you towards dryland do not use all sufferings later some people do it Gesu but that equal choice in drypoint, usually one guy takes seeds the other one in diasporas so this place will be flat čoulu boom that we use in shrubbing we bring網 and we light weekly then what profit will we get from it we should think commercial people think that agriculture can not thinking commercial so everyone should think commercial brother let me ask you a thing, now day you are doing the sow farmyard training still remaining of your land with the deposits left. Is it possible that they allow you to sow the seeds now itself? Let's get rid of those Umsno Partners Let's get rid of those Adding so much effort into it you will not be able to earn even that... opinions like that of Ragi P runway on one hand everything is perfect but on the other you plant्s and Make it a two-year plan, take some advice from it, and then make marketing your creative plan. All these are scientific. If you are a big farmer, do an IPO. You need knowledge for the IPO. If you have the knowledge, you will have the knowledge for the future. The farmer producing organization is being implemented by the central government. I have been asking many farmers to make another 100 farmers. But they are not able to do it. Because the farmers are not aware of the situation. All these are concepts. What do you think about our agriculture? I have not seen agriculture in this condition. Many people are my fans. Many people have called me. I have seen your Gulbargadu Jai. Many people have called me. Many people have called me. I have seen 150 people have come to my training. More than 150 people have come. If you see the farm in the south, you will see it everywhere. But if you see our side, no one does it. They just grow it for a year. They see what happens next year. And then they grow it for the next year. Sir, I have seen your YouTube channel and the farm. I have answered all the critical questions. I am ready to answer. What else can I say? Sir, some of us don't know. What is the difference between Raktachandana and Sri Gandha? This is the main thing. What is the difference between Raktachandana and Sri Gandha? Sri Gandha is a farm that is not supported by any other farm. It needs hosting. People do this. They come and say that they have seen something. But you have seen it. Do you know the difference? The difference is that the farm is not supported by the other farm. They come and say that they have seen something. Then they say, let us see what happens next. This is the difference between Raktachandana and Sri Gandha. If you see the central part of the farm, You will see that the same thing is happening. But when you see the central part, If you see the central part of the farm, It is different. It is different. It is different. You will see the difference. But if you see the central part, Raktachandana is the same. If you see the central part, in both the wood, one will become weak so for Sri ganda, there should be a balance for rakta chandana, there is no balance rakta chandana will grow individually for Sri ganda, timber, wood and soil will grow in this case, soil is being taken from the roots I have seen that the roots are being taken this is the angle for rakta chandana Sri ganda is costly according to my knowledge, rakta chandana is going to wood Sri ganda is very good in this world, the most costly wood is agarwood it is very expensive agarwood is very expensive we have training on agarwood we will give information on where to get agarwood agarwood is very costly sir, have you grown it anywhere in Karnataka? in Karnataka, we have grown it in Karnataka, we have taken training in a royal pond I have given 10 sassi of agarwood now it is grown there for that, grafting is required at a certain time then it is very costly sir, what kind of weather is required for that? it is normal weather after it grows, after it reaches a height there are scientific methods for that all that is done and planned in a way that is not forgotten for that, it is necessary to have a plan I have a plan sir, how long will it take for the sri ganda to grow? if you want a proper dry land minimum 20 years is required 20 years is required if you want 15 years, then it is said if you want 20 years, then it is required if you have a little more time it will take 15-16 years sir, how much can you grow per acre of sri ganda? sir, per acre of sri ganda depends upon whether you grow main or sub-garden it depends on that as far as I know, from 250 to 200 acres per acre is comfortable if you have a lot of land, then it will not grow see, our government is giving many schemes but the farmers are not following the schemes of the government there are many schemes all the departments and the brochures are there every training, every year, every week I am telling you all the schemes I have given you the schemes of IHR all the farmers should know about it and after our training we will give you an authorised certificate if you want to do loan or something else this certificate will be eligible all these will be very beneficial for you sir, for example if you grow sri ganda per acre how much will it be in 20 years? sir, I am telling you if 1 kg sri ganda grows as wood it will cost 16 lakhs if it grows as oil, it will cost more if we guess approximately it will cost 2-3 crores approximately approximately from 2014-15 most of the government has given us the credit that everyone grows in the land of Kasgi most of the sri ganda that grows as sri ganda is not available according to our statistics now, there are some sri ganda that grows as sri ganda but they have lost their profit now, sri ganda that grows as sri ganda is available for 6-7 years if it grows as sri ganda for 6-7 years the number of sri ganda that grows as sri ganda will be less that is the clarity of the sri ganda if it grows as sri ganda for 6-7 years how much will it grow in 1 acre? same from 1 acre it can grow to 200 if it grows to 100 it can grow to 250 how long will it grow? same sir, it will grow to 20 years how much will it grow in that? sri ganda will not grow that much it will grow to 1-2 crores approximately it will grow that much today's number is a mistake we don't know how this sri ganda is used? how can we find the right way? there is a scientific fact in sri ganda this is called as halli sri ganda many people don't know this concept in sri ganda, first the sri ganda is grown in trees the sri ganda is used because the sri ganda is grown in trees the sri ganda is very tasty the stem of the tree is made of wood and the wood is made of wood to make that tree, it is made of wood now, the sri ganda we grow the sri ganda we grow the taste of the sri ganda is less than that of the native sri ganda but in future our stem will not grow any hole we can change our stem that is why we are growing this type of sri ganda leaving the native sri ganda the sri ganda that has crossed the seeds the government is giving it in our private nurseries we are getting it when you grow this type of sri ganda in future you can grow your stem for the purpose of sri ganda if you grow this type of stem if you do any kind of brokerage it will go to the level of the building if you do any kind of brokerage directly it will be profitable what you need in the agriculture is the importance of the marketing that is the main thing finally, what do you say about the Samagra agriculture and your training system for the farmers and the farmers please do not leave the native sri ganda as a dry land India is a land of farmers agriculture is the main thing every youth even if they are 5-6 years old the native sri ganda is not a burden on their land they can take the land and grow the land and get good clean air and rain if we are clean the future generation will be good please encourage the youth and everyone to do Samagra agriculture with the money and the land that is my last conclusion finally, we thank you for your valuable time and information that you have given to us and to our viewers thank you so much

SandalWoodNewsStories_197.mp3: BERDIEnels you should create a good ROI income If you make 6000 rupees, you will get a good income. But, it will fail in many ways. Why it will fail, why we are giving it, what we should do, I will give you the information. I have said that, when we look at Indian epics and Qurans, we have many information about Srinath. I will not discuss about it. There are many uses for it. There is a medicine called oil. Today, they have published a paper on the use of oil to cure cancer. Till then, Srikanth has been strong. The strength of Srikanth is that, some industries have become dependent on Srikanth's oil. They are doing their own plantation. You can ask about Parparag industry. In Mandipuradesh, there is a place called Kutni. That place is called Parparag. They have done their own plantation. For their business, what they do is, for that Parparag business, they have to get a cent. They have to get a cent for all Srikanth's oil. Otherwise, the cent is not available. So, they have to get Srikanth's oil fixed. Because of that property, they do not need that oil. They have done their own plantation. So, Srikanth is a place in Karnataka and it is a place for other countries. They have some interest in this region. They have won private parties, farmers, some have done their own NGO. In Maharashtra, they have done some training in a place called Nammatru. They have done nursery there. They have done some research there. It is a not traditional area. I have some information about that. Why is there an economics? Everyone has a question. I have come to ask about economics. Why should you learn economics? That is, If we compare the economic growth of Srikanth, we should know the economic growth of Srikanth. Because Srikanth has many challenges. It is difficult to sell the seedlings and to grow the trees. It is also difficult to sell the colour of the trees and to get the right amount of money. So, when we sell such a challenging crop, we should know the cost of the crop. If we know the cost of the crop, we should decide whether to sell it or not. The most important thing is the economics of sandal. When we study the economics of sandal, we should understand the complexity of sandal. We should understand the complexity of sandal. If we understand the complexity of sandal, we can understand the importance of sandal. Srikanth is a challenging crop because it is not the only crop. If you want to grow another crop, you have to buy an alternate host. It is not possible to grow different types of trees in different stages. So, it is challenging. If we understand the complexity of sandal, we can understand the economics of sandal. First, Srikanth has a lot of work. Next, we have to understand the cost of the alternate host. The cost of the alternate host is the result of the production. So, the economics of sandal varies. That is why the selection of the alternate host is important. And, this is decision making. Every stage has to be taken. If you observe the stages and the decisions taken, you will understand the next level. I will explain it to you. These are different crops. You have to collect the villages in these phases. This is the採ast sector. We have mysft at that time never, not will leave here. Tipi potrzeves such a circle in the soccer field. When noatl referring to these are that of the cyclical fields. In such week, we need to bring the aspect ofassa like. both are drip many different types. this is your first site preparation this is my first demonstration video that shows theseras gratitude First we have to select the land, we have to see the soil surface, we have to see the soil surface to know if the sand can rise or not So we have to test the sand in the soil surface, we have to collect the sand in our agricultural centers, universities and soil scientists labs and we have to test it at a reasonable rate In that report you will get the meaning of the soil, why the soil is less, the soil scientists will ask you if you can grow the tree crops here or not, they will give you a report If you have nitrogen, what should you do? If you have nitrogen, what should you do? You will get a report For that, you have to follow all these The most important thing for the sand is pH If you have 6.5 to 7.8 pH in your sand, it is safe If you have pH, it means hydrogen ion concentration is reduced That pH is very important because the imbalance of pH is that the soil of the plants is not properly moved The soil of the plants is also not properly moved The soil of the plants is also not properly moved So, if the soil is in a neutral pH, the absorption and exchange of the ions is correct So, the soil is also good So, the pH is very important We have to see the organic carbon as well Organic carbon means the amount of carbon in it If the organic carbon content is good, the plants will be more If you are doing nutrients or if you are doing crops, you can keep it in your hands and use it for your plants If you are doing nutrients or if you are doing crops, you can keep it in your hands and use it for your plants So, you have to see all these things After the soil is tested, they say that the soil is in neutral pH You can grow the soil in this place quickly If you are doing nutrients or if you are doing crops, you can grow the soil in this place quickly So, we are explaining that if you have selected a particular soil, you have to select a particular vector After selecting the selected soil, you have to do land preparation Now, the place is ready To do land preparation, you have to use a lot of stones, bricks, and other materials To do this, you have to spend a lot of money to maintain the soil So, if you spend a lot of money, you can do land preparation You can do a lot of work like planting trees, planting a tractor, ploughing, etc. So, you have to select the land that is less expensive and you can do a lot of work Selection of land is very important Next, the slope The driver has said that the slope is very important Water should flow cleanly when the land is being planted The water that has come to the edge should be there to stop the rain Now, the land is ready You have to do planting The slope is not given, land preparation is done directly So, after the land preparation, the next question comes What should be done next? After the land preparation, you have to do the fitting I have given a slope of 11 meters I have given a slope of 2% and I have done the level and I am ready You have to do the fitting What we do after the plantings is We go to the forest department and give the application Sir, I want to do a subsidy You have to prepare a lot of land in your subsidiary You have to give the land from the Aadhar card It is ready You have to do planting in June July The marks will start in June July You have to do planting So, before planting, you have to do the fitting When to do the fitting How to do the fitting At what distance to do the fitting Why to do the fitting All these questions come to mind When to do the fitting, I say that the land should be in the size of a heart Usually, I recommend 45 cm x 45 cm 45 cm x 45 cm One by one, one by one, one by one, one by one Why one by one, one by one, one by one All those one by one, one by one, one by one The size of the seedling The size of the seedling That size of the pit should be correct The type of the heart should be Who will do the planting If I have to do the planting in June Should I do it in one month or three months Question Who will do the planting You should not expect to do the planting in January February Because In January February, the winter season starts The base season starts March, April, full base season In that base season The heart will not be planted The soil will be exposed to the sun light The sun light will fall on the soil The weather will be good The weather will be good The soil will be good In January August My tule My tule vue My ty raisons End I think we will give the seedling to the nursery and cover it with a plastic cover when you give the seedling to the nursery, you will first remove the top layer of the soil then you will add a farm yard manure to the soil if you add a farm yard manure to the soil, it will increase the water holding capacity and when you do planting, you will irrigate the soil with flood irrigation you will irrigate the soil with flood irrigation so that the water can get absorbed because if you start planting in June, it will rain and you will not know when it will rain again so you will water the soil first to avoid risk water the soil and make sure it is clean

SandalWoodNewsStories_229.mp3:  Music Welcome to Kavash story, I am Vijayalakshmi Sibaruru When the forest was in danger, we all stood up We were happy that all the trees of our land were destroyed But, I will tell you a truth that will make us happy In our Bengaluru's forest, we are making the noise of crores of rupees I will tell you the truth, come One day, a foreign land came That was the land of the one who loves the environment He married a strange lady That is in the forest of Bengaluru, crores of rupees are being stolen You will have to cover that story At first, he thought they were joking. Because, in a concrete forest like Bengaluru, where should we get crores of rupees? But, they are doing it step by step and the land's wealth is getting reduced. Please, you also come here and open our planet's eyes. The cover story that was written for his wife was called as Gnanadegula Gnanabharati. The people who were eagerly waiting for us welcomed us. They were very excited and took us to the campus of Bengaluru University. The forest here is getting more and more rough. The plastic is getting torn. The campus is becoming plastic. The construction of the building is getting more and more rough. The trees and the animals are being destroyed as shown in the video. But, we did not get any crores of rupees from Shri Gandhada. Because of this, our heart started to feel sad. But, our feelings melted as we entered the Gnanabharati Ghandhada temple. Because, we felt the shock here. We were shocked by the scenes here. Here, the trees of Shri Gandhada were being destroyed. Yes, here, crores of rupees have been stolen from Shri Gandhada. From the ground, we could get all the Shri Gandhada's items. Today, even the small ones and big ones. You can get more than 20,000 to 25,000 rupees from this piece. But, these pieces have been destroyed. If you are taking big pieces from this, there is no security here. Shri Gandhada is our country's pride and glory. But, here, the property of the forest is destroyed. The forest is not there. The trees of Dharaguruli are the story of Karala. They are the ones who take care of the forest. They do the work. How many trees are there? You can see it from there. Yes. But, you have been here for a day or two. Now, you are laughing. Oh, God! I have no place to stay here. Look at the entire forest. There are so many trees. Is it? Once upon a time, the VV Avarana of Bengaluru was a big forest. This was a place where the animals and animals of the forest were kept. This was called the Gandhada temple. There were lakhs of Gandhada trees here. In the 80s, there were many Gandhada trees in this village. The professor remembers the days when Shri Gandha was always in Gandhada. I was born in 1983. Since then, I have been saying that there are no Gandhada trees. I can see the number of Gandhada trees in this village. There are many. I have been saying this to give priority to this university. This is a Gandhada forest in Bengaluru. We have protected this as a top priority. That is why, this university has been so well preserved. But, in this Gandhada place, there is a lot of Gandhada trees. Shri Gandhada is a land of black. Every day, at least 2 to 3 trees are sacrificed to the black forest. There are no snakes. The roadside is very narrow. There are many more inside. That is why, we have to hide them. The trees are left there. After a week or two, they are cut into small pieces and taken away. In the bio park of the department of environment science, Shri Gandhada is being taken care of. It is a rumour that he is taking care of Gandhada. It is very easy. We are standing in front of this road. When we are about to take him, he is being taken away by the stone. There are 33 people in the private security of the university. They are not paying attention. No one is asking if the stone is broken. When we see the Gandhada trees that have been cut down in the ground, we can see that the tree is not broken and the tree is not broken. When we see the tree, we can see that the trees are broken and the trees are If it is involved, nothing can be done. Okay, here in Apara Pramanada, Shree Gantha is there. If we calculate that there might have been a huge contribution to the world science, then the answer will be clear. Because, this much Shree Gantha's trees were washed by the stone. There is no contribution from the world science. Now, if we do another plantation in Kelkada, in the valley from the first building to this one, if we do a complete sandalwood plantation in that region, it would be very good. If we cut it, and if we replace the sandalwood trees with the ones from the committee, then we should get a general suggestion. What a bad thing! Look at this! Even though the stone which was placed in his hand is a stone, the world science is in a state of chaos. The planet society is in a state of confusion. The people of Aranya have no knowledge. When so many Shree Gantha's trees were being destroyed, our police were standing still. What was the reason for this? Or, is there any use for them? I will discuss all these doubts after a short break.

Gopal, you have been given information that there is a sign on the wall of the park. Why? Why did you say that? No, I didn't say that. No one has explained it clearly. We need to see it. It is an FIR. We didn't say anything about the sign. You said that even though there is so much security, how would it be? If there is no security, then how would it be? Security is that this is an open forest. It is a 65 acres area. So, we need to see it. There is no dead tree here. There is a white sapwood. There is no hardwood. So, we need to see it. We have filed an FIR in the National Park. They are doing it separately. We need to see it. Do you have any doubt about it? No, I don't have any doubt. They are doing it separately.

SandalWoodNewsStories_215.mp3:  How did you start the Sandlot Plantation? We started our farm about 30 years ago. We had no idea that it would take a year or a year and we started to do some other things. We started to do some other things and we started to do some other things. We had alreadyических, simple or granular land and umbilical mixtures which was cut with thin tendons. We used teak , honey and mahogany from the emacea for other neighbourhoods. We had also sowing canola andenda . We had peyote seeds of cassava seed that shaft controlled by cassava seems to use for planting as fertilizer. We have brought these today to take care of it from bottom to top. We have may have been planning on using on había seed for some years now. We have 16 trees here. We have about 20,000 Sri Gandhaga trees. It has been 7 years since it was planted. The trees have started to grow. The more we give host to the trees, the better the tree grows. Especially in dry land, like Karnataka, Mysore, Chhamarajinagar, Chikaballapura, Sri Gandhaga has a high percentage of oil content. The belt trees can give a good impression of the area. They can be used for planting vegetables, or for planting seeds. The trees are planted in the rainy season. You have to work hard for 3-4 years to grow them. Because it is raining. After 3 years, the plants will develop well. After that, the rain will stop and you will be able to grow vegetables. For the first 3 years, you have to work hard to get water in the tractor. You will get the results of that. Why don't you need any other type of grapes? You can give the same type of grapes to the family. You can give the same type of grapes to the family. If you have the same type of grape fruit, you don't need to use any other type of他们 You can produce different types of grapes like kiwis, blackberries, daikon If you are bem converged in покуп integiertly , you will not need those hagaars like this one. And mostly the problem of this arising is, What is the main problem that you face? How many years have you been developing oil? It depends on the environment. Some people ask for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. All the natural conditions that you need, you get them from the 4th year of the oil production. From the 4th year of the oil production, practically, what we see in our fields, there is a gap in the soil for 4 years. But the oil content can be there. It started from the 4th year of the heartwood production. I have not mentioned this in my book, but it is natural, it is done in our fields. So, it can take 15 years to grow. Some people say it takes 10 years, 15 years. There is a difference between 10 years and 15 years. In 10 years, you can get 5 kgs, or you can get 3 kgs of chags. In 15 years, you can get 10 kgs, 12 kgs, or up to 20 kgs. You can see the growth rate, and what you have done to it. The only thing is, the white ants, the Gatluva, they eat a lot of the grass. If you look at it closely, you will not find any other plants that have not been found so far. Is this suitable for red soil only, or for black soil, or clay soil? It can be suitable for all soils. But, I am not talking about the oil content. Red loamy soils, or stone soils, small stones, or stone-stones, if you have red soil, it will grow very well. It will grow in all areas. Growth will be there everywhere. But, oil content is more in these areas. What should be done for security? You should ensure the security of your home. No one else should come and do it. I cannot do it. People say that we can do this, we can do that. But, you should do fencing, and do some other things. If you do it on a small scale, it will be very difficult in the future. Because, it is difficult to do it for the people. If you have 500-1000 fields, it will be difficult to do it for the people. Because, the income will be lost. That is why, if farmers do it on a large scale, 2000-3000 fields, how many fields should be there in an acre? Usually, it is ideal to have 400 fields. If we do it in high density, we have done it. We have planted 600-700 fields. Now, we should plant it in a good method. Even if the land is dry land, if you plant it in 5 acres, what will happen is, from the third year, the soil that was cut, you can use it for crops, it will be profitable. If you sow it for 10 years, the seeds will come, they will come and give you 100-150 rupees per kg. That is why, you will get the harvest. Even if you sow it for 10 years, you will get the harvest. You can plant it there, plant 10-20 trees, or whatever you want, you can grow it, and you can harvest it. What is the rate of the blood? We have a mill in Madurai. It has been 8-6 years. We have planted it for 10 years. We have not left it alone. Every year, we have planted it in the rain. We have replanted it. We have all the stages in our field. We have 4-year plants, 8-year plants, we have planted it like that. Every farmer should do the same. If you do not see it, it will not grow. And, you cannot reach the expectation. So, in this way, you have made a silver row. Yes, we have made a silver row. All the fields support it. There is no such host or such a thing. There may be many hosts. Nimbai, Mosambi, they are all very good hosts. All the Seabays. But, every field, from the soil, is a host. There is no such species. So, you do not need to take the soil? No, we do not need the soil. I have told you, you take the soil, and make a hole, or do open grazing system. Open grazing is not possible for 3-4 years. Because, every hole, when it comes, the soil gets dirty. If it crosses 5-6 feet, it takes minimum 3 years. After those 3 years, you can do open grazing. Ok. Is there any problem with the permission of the forest department? No problem. Forest department will supply the soil for 3 rupees. They will give the amount of soil. You should look for good soil, and take the soil from the seed. Don't go to the nursery and say, this soil is like this. Don't go there. You should take the soil from the natural forest. If there are some problems哦 here now and there, no problem for this to happen. But for early seed Чтоch and you can get a good income from it. Instead of thinking about how much you will get by doing a lot of hives, think about how much you will get by doing all the hives. Don't just think about that for 10 to 20 years. Do what you want and when you do it in parallel, you will get a guarantee for a bank deposit. If you do a 1000 hives, you can get a 500 hives deposit. Even if you do 100 hives for the color, the people, or the white ants, you can get a 500 hives deposit if you save 15 years. You can do whatever you want in your life. If you need saplings, will you contact them? We don't go to the market for saplings. We don't contact them. We don't go to the market for saplings. We don't contact them. You can go to the local nursery. You can go to the local nursery. You can go to the local nursery. You can buy the saplings that are in the government nursery. We have Chintamani, Srinivasapura, Kolar. All the nurseries have passed the forest department's resolution. All the nurseries have to be certified.

SandalWoodNewsStories_242.mp3:  Welcome back to BreakAad In the past few years, everyone had a desire to do agriculture in a way that everyone could do. But, we have heard that many people are not interested in Shree Ghanda's agriculture. But, how to do it, what to do, where to start, how to learn, all these questions are there. We have with us the person who has achieved all these. He will talk to us about how he achieved this, how difficult it is, or what is the easy way. We welcome him first. Hello, Mr. Vishu Kumar. Hello. Sir, I have told you about this. But, before that, let us see a video. Yes. Vishu Kumar, the famous Shree Ghanda's farmer, was born in Chikmagaluru district, Tarikeri. After that day, he started his business. He started his business by earning a lot of money. Meanwhile, he was interested in agriculture. He was interested in agriculture because he was interested in the business. He was interested in the benefits of agriculture. He decided to do Shree Ghanda's agriculture in Konda Bhoomi. He started Shree Ghanda's agriculture in a small amount. After that, he started his business in Konda Bhoomi. After that, he started his business in Abumadals report. After that, he started his business inатоom and bollam businesses. He started his business in Darug said あり âyerneyt xe ku�� terugö 할âhâ. Back then, he was doing various activities in rural areas in many cities, He did a lot of experiments in such countries too. Amongst the product of his land, Shree Ghanda did agriculture planting in pour estate. and how he has shown his talent. Sir, we watched the video and were very happy. We thought that we should do something like this. But when it comes to achievement, it becomes a big issue. And the situation behind it is also very bad. When did you decide to do this? In 2003-2004, our area was very poor. Nandu and Chikmangalu districts were very poor. In that area, in the 16 acres, a forest was dug up. After the dug up of the forest, we were thinking about what we should do. We were thinking about what to do in the rain. So, when we came to the rain, we saw that the forest was full of trees. So, we decided to dig up the forest and we decided to dig up the Sagwani. Because the 4 acres of the forest dug up in the banyan tree was completely dug up. That is what we did. So, we decided to dig up the forest in the banyan tree in the rain. At that time, we saw that the TEEK was being built. Along with the TEEK, we also had permission to build the Srikanta in 2001-2002. So, we had an advertisement. If you build the Srikanta today, you will get a lakh rupees for 10 years. We had an advertisement and we were searching for the forest. So, I thought of building the Srikanta. In 2005, I was not able to remember that the Srikanta was a net. So, it has been 11 years now. I am very happy that I have built a Srikanta tree for 15 years. I have earned a profit of 180,000 rupees. In how many acres have you built it? I started with 4 acres. Now, I have increased it to 44 acres. So, in the Freedom Map, I have already told you how to build and protect it. I have also told you that. They will be able to develop it after seeing it. It is easy to say that our success secret is not to tell. So, you were saying that you have to build it and protect it. You have to protect it. You have told that the number of stones is more. So, you have to protect it. Have you explained everything in that app? Yes, it is in that app. After developing that app, no one will leave the secret of building it. No one will leave it. But, the farmers have to develop it. And, the Srikanta tree should be developed further. Because, the Srikanta tree is very important in the entire world. So, everyone should use it. And, they should also become a Srimanth. I have told you that secret in this app. So, everyone should use it and develop it. Generally, when we do any work, we should have complete knowledge about it. But, it is not possible to do it in a short time. It is very difficult to do it in a short time. It is very difficult to do it thinking that we should do it without any doubt. And, it is very difficult to become successful. So, when we do any work, we should have complete knowledge. Or, how important is the knowledge gathering? Definitely, when we do any work, we should have a teacher. We should have a teacher in front of us. In that way, no one is there in today's time. Now, there are many people who have grown up to do it as much as they want. Now, there is an app called Freedom. So, from that, we will get complete knowledge about it. So, how to plant the seed, how to make water, how to make coconut oil. How to protect it? How to give it to the plants? All these are the basic knowledge. If we understand all these and do it, we can become successful. So, we should earn a lot of money. Sir, should we take a license for that? There is no license for taking a license. In 2001 or 2002, the government has freezed it. So, anyone can grow it. After growing it, there is a restriction from the government to cut it. So, according to the procedure, we have to ask permission from the government to cut it. They will give permission. So, the last announcement was made in the budget. In 2021, the government is making a law called Shree Gandha. In a few days, it can be introduced in that law. If it is introduced, anyone can cut it. Anyone can do it anywhere. So, from the Shree Gandha that we have, not only we are happy, our country is also happy. Because, the tax that I am presenting now is the tax that no one purchases from us. They get 32% tax. 18% GST, 12% forest development, and 2% IT. In this way, 32% tax. And, if I am doing the Maratha, they will give 22% tax on us. 10% supervision charges and 12% classification charges. 55% goes to the government. So, if I go, and if I get Rs. 1 crore, I will get Rs. 55 lakhs tax. From that, if I go to the forest, it is very difficult. So, from that, we will provide good food for the environment. From the department of forest development, the air will be more. The weather will be more. The birds will get food for their pets. So, from all these, we will not be doing anything to our own property. From now on, we will provide ten times more food for the environment. Because, for the separate animals, , Fasting and working are important toстраggling. We also play with other plants to preserve full pitched area and can get plenty of pay. Since Malayashtra is being cultivated, we don't have to work hard for it. This is a kind of a Sombere Beli. It is a bitra that protects itself. The rest is not a big problem. There is no loss in it. Because in the entire world, there is a lot of demand for Sri Ganesha. In the open market, it is Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 50,000 for 1 kg. So, for those who have a big heart, we have a lot of money. So, there is no loss in it. When I did it, it was Rs. 1,500 per kg. In 2005, it is now Rs. 12,000 per kg. Here, it is in government rate. In the open market, it is Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 50,000. So, if the open market is done, the rate will increase. So, when people grow, they will get the right. There is no problem in it. It will get a good profit. Sir, if I want to see your course, what should I do in the Freedom App? So, you have to download the Freedom App. In that, you have to enter the code VISHU SANDAL in the Freedom App. You have to see it and then enter Sri Ganesha Beli Board. Ok Sir, you have told us a lot of things. You have given us a lot of thoughts. What are the questions? How to protect? You have given us all the details. Thank you Sir. Thank you. Thank you also. In our Freedom App, the students who have taken this course will appear. They too will be very comfortable and will be able to work with the environment. So, thank you also. You can also see the course of VISHU KUMAR in the Freedom App. You can learn a lot. You have two benefits. One, you can learn about it completely. And, their referral code is being played on the screen. If you see it and enter it, you will get Rs. 3000 and scholarship. You can get two benefits. Now, let us take a short break.
SandalWoodNewsStories_278.mp3:  We are here to share our experiences with you about the 4 parts of the country that we are a part of. But today we are introducing you to a different kind of farmer. Yes, they have grown their small land to a new size and have built a new farm. They have inspired many farmers. Our Karnataka is a famous country for its home and land. So we have to be careful. Initially, the farmers of Sri Gandhava did not grow their land. But even then, there is no problem. The government is promoting this development. So, the farming has started in different parts of the country since the last few years. Many farmers have grown their land since then. In Chinnadanadu, Kolarajiliya, Kolaara district, Gopalakrishnan, Sri Gandhava has grown its land in about 12 acres. Along with that, the farmers have grown their own land. Here you can see the village of Arahalli, in Kolarathalu. This is the Gopalakrishnan Vara Tota. Sri Gandhava has grown its land for about 6 years. There are around 2000 trees here. The farmers have been using the water to grow their land. This is Sri Gandhava Paravalumbika. It is the main farm of this area. it is said that it is growing well Vraitha Gopalakrishnan In Arelli village in survey number 59 I have planted 12 acres of Sri Gandha while planting Sri Gandha along with that we need to make a pond because this Gandha is not strong enough to be planted with water or coconut so along with this we have planted Gandha for 2 years we have made it drip and grown it why we have pruned it is because this plant has developed we don't prune it from the bottom we take only 3 feet from the bottom and leave it on top it has been 6 years we have planted it but it has not grown well it grows slowly because Gandha is not good usually department will say that 10-12 years Gandha will start according to me it will take 20 years it has been 6 years I have seen all the farmers to make Gandha we have planted all the plants in Mahunthottakal to make Gandha now only 500 people have planted it we have planted maavu, tomato, avareghada beans, papaya we have planted all the plants and have grown it for 6 years maavu has grown to a good quality now we have to take maavu Shree Gandha is a very strong tree a big fear for the farmers who grow it for 15-20 years today is肥ø 애 but the others wherever they grow they quemt not easy scenes They will arrest us in the DC office, in the government buildings, in the forests. They will threaten us about our progress. But we have done it. We have done it. But we have done it. We have asked the government to give us a subsidy for the pensions. After 8-9 years, we have decided to give them a subsidy. This is a soap factory in Maratha. This is a factory in Bengaluru. They will make an agreement. They will agree to give us the money at that rate. But I am not sure. I have not made any other agreement. Is this soap factory beneficial for the farmers? Because, today, the prices of tomatoes are high. So, the farmers are struggling to earn. Because, today, you will see, the price of the same crop is increasing. Every crop is growing in double. So, they are doing it at a low rate. They are in a situation where they are struggling to earn. For that, today, when we produce this soap We take it out andiva, So, today, we will take out as adapter. When it grows this way, when it! And we recycle the worker almost three times, because�� This is a direct way to get the best results. The farmer has cut the small plants and fed them to the cows and goats. The first farmer does not have permission to harvest in his land. This law is now in place. The farmer can harvest easily without any tension. This is why the gardeners and the forestry sector are also supporting this. Initially, the trees of Sri Gandhada were only seen in the forest. But since 2001, the government has given Sri Gandhada to the Raita as a house. The law has also allowed this tree to grow in the land of Raita. In this country, this tree is growing at an altitude of about 1000 acres. The gardeners and forestry sector have also been supporting Sri Gandhada's farming. The Raita has been supported by the Raita. In the first year, the Raita's hectare is now able to support about 40,000 people. Krishnamurthy, the gardener, has been the one who has been advising the Raita to buy the trees from the forest. We are promoting the National Ayush Mission from the department of articles. The Raita has been legalized. The Raita can now grow its own trees in Sri Gandhada. There are no other opportunities like this. The Raita has been legalized. The forestry sector and the gardeners have been promoting the Raita to the Raita. We are promoting the Raita. The Raita has grown in the last three years. Sri Gandhada has grown about 40 hectares. The Raita has grown into an inter-crop. The Raita has grown into a mawal. It has grown into a seabed. It has grown into a support. We are giving 40,000 per hectare for the first year of Sri Gandhada's growth. We are giving 10,000 per hectare for the seventh year. They are getting 50,000 per hectare in the next seven years. They are getting 50,000 per hectare for the planting material and the nutrients they need. They don't need anything else. Sri Gandhada's seedlings are available in the forest department. In our area, we only get Huli mawal. So, we have to take the Raita from the recognized farms. Or we have to get it from the forest department. Before getting it, if we need help from our department, they have to register it. We have two websites, Fruits and Hasiru. They have to register it formally. We issue a work order to them. After that, they have to get the seedlings from NHP accredited or forest department and plant them in their field. So, the next process is to submit the application to the department. We have to submit the required documents. We have to deposit the RTAs through them. It is very simple. As simple as in other departments or schemes. It is very simple to grow and get benefits from the department. In Kolharajili, the majority of the farmers are growing tomatoes, mawa, potatoes and other vegetables. There are also a lot of other vegetables like Neelagiri. Instead of that, farmers are getting blood sugar, blood sugar, Shree Gandha, and other types of other vegetables. For the last 8-10 years, the interest in Shree Gandha agriculture has been increasing. In the Indian Agricultural Development Initiative, farmers are getting a loan of Rs.100 for 3 years of farming. After the farmers have been given the land, the government has given the money to the government, or to the government-owned companies, to make the farmers grow their crops. The local department has been appointed to the department of social agriculture. We have grown more than 10 lakhs of Shree Gandha vegetables. The farmers have grown them. In the present year, Shree Gandha has a yield of Rs.7000 per kg. The farmers have grown their crops. The forest has a propensity to grow. I want to give a word of caution, even if it is just one area, if several acres are available for salad, it is fathers food for about 5 people. They keep it in a storage and store that kids чув to theirvan. You can see that it is grown into seedlings. By this Cola tree. some people are growing papaya and other horticulture species but since it is a farm, it is better to grow it with other plants now it is a direct soap and detergent for soap production or for handicrafts it is possible to change it directly so we realize its benefits the market is not there physiciansya can again change accoutding the brands according to the standard rate yes chip найти препat Seo taught us these tips might can also be an advantage this chip finder can also � thou 🏻🏻 Let's take care of these chips pick them very well probablypler america's macней even when it gets passed hopefully they can be found stronger Our Aashiyar, Raghuraj, News 8 Kannada, Kolhara Plantation plantations, the government is also protesting against this plantations Why? Because there is no filling, no The plantations supported by the government have seis times their duty Whether it was rain,��니 severe crop loss Plantations as sweet fruit, less dependency on labors And , The problem with it is the oil and seawater In addition coal market was on the rise The land is being re-planted. The state's farmers are also taking this step. In the same way, the Haveri district's Vadagi Taluk, Chikkabasuru village's Arvind Lingadalli is also one of them. For the last 6 years, they have been planting land in 6 acres. About 50 to 300 acres of land has been cultivated here. The water supply system has been improved. The company has been providing nutrition to the farmers. The fields have also grown well. The land we have has been provided with water. We can grow any kind of land. Even if you don't have any land, you can grow it. The land is not good for growing. We can grow it. The company provides us with the land. The land is not good for growing. We can't grow it. We are not able to grow it. We don't have the land. The government has made an agreement with the district. The company supplies us with the land. They also make the decisions and mark the land. There are 30 acres of land. The soil is not good. The land is given a zigzag method. The soil is not good. The land is given a zigzag method. The water supply system is called the drip system. The drip system is a loop system. The soil is surrounded by a 3 feet long dripper. The water supply system is called the drip system. The soil is not good. The soil is not good. The soil is not good.

To do this the soil and water supply... The soil and water supply systems will not work. The hallway and the plastic주고... ... will need the basic system. It needs to be care surround the hall. Because of water itself there is no comfort. Arvind Linga Dalai has been working for the company for the last 3 years. He is currently selling 4 tons of land for 6 acres of land every month. He is earning around Rs. 40,000 from his 35 years of experience. Sir, this is our work. We have been doing this for 3 years. We started cutting the land after 7 years. But actually, it is recommended to cut the land after 3 years. But in our field, we started cutting the land after 7 years. We cut the land after 3 years. What we have done is, we have installed a land in Taliavili. If we start cutting the land after 3 years, we can cut the land from 3 to 5 acres of land. But we can cut the land from the land after 3 to 5 acres of land. We have been doing this for a long time. The main cost of this is cut. There is a zero condition. The main cost of this is cut. We are in labour for 10 years. If we get labour from labour, we can cut the land and send it to the factory. Arvind Linga Dalai has gone to Taliavili. He has been working for Taliavili for the last 7 years. He has just started cutting the land from 30 to 40 tons of land. We know the importance of the land. We have to do long term crops. We have to make sure that the crops are not damaged by the increase in the year. This is the only way. I have planted 3 acres of land. After that, I have planted 3 acres of land. Now I have started to give money to the land. I have been giving money for 1-2 tons of land for 3 years. Land farming was a central government project. This was established by the land owners. The company has to pay the price of the land. So, the construction of the land is not done. For the first 6-7 years, the company has not been able to pay the interest rate. The land farming has been going on for 6 years. In the last 6 years, the land owners have been doing good and are doing well. Did you see, scientists? The land that was planted by the land owners is now being used by the farmers. The land that was planted by the land owners is now being used by the farmers. Our aim is to make the land more fertile.

Now we have to ask and give. Why? Because the government should not support the farmers. Those who are farmers should support them. So the government is listening to us. Now the ministers and others are in constant contact. We have to make an association with the farmers. But from now on to sell the land we have to sell it to the players. We can sell it to them. This law has not existed yet. But in the next 2-3 years it will change. You can sell it to private people. Now we are doing our work to make our own Moulavardhani. We have the opportunity to purchase sandalwood. Now what we have is I have 100 acres of land and Ramesh Balwati has 5000 acres of land. 5000 acres. In any country if we want 15000 crores of land we don't have to go anywhere. If we come to Ramesh Balwati in the coming days we will get worth 15000 crores of sandalwood. Even if we have that now we don't know what will happen to the farmers or the current situation of the land. Now our soap will start soap, cosmetics, perfumes, agarbathi and other by-products will start. But even if I have 100 acres of land I cannot sell the land that I own to the Moulavardhani. But they will make in India is what they say. In this place they will make Moulavardhani and make a market and also make a job. But today regarding Sri Gandha I don't have the opportunity to make Moulavardhani. I have already registered as Gandha Medicinal and Aromatic Company. But in a few days it will start. I have to purchase oils from someone else and I have to do soap and cosmetics. But we are ready for that. But our request to the government is that for the land we should liberalize it. We should give a little to the people who give medical bills so that their land doesn't change. We have a request to the government. We have discussed it with the government. We have discussed it with the government. In the future, in a few days we can give this opportunity. But now there is an existing law that we have to give to KSDL. To the R&L and to KSDL. How to do it? I mean I am a young man. Do I need permission for the old? You don't need permission for the old. What we have to do is we have to give a loan to KSDL and to R&L. Then what KSDL will do is they will also give the money to R&L that we will purchase with all our documents. They will also give an affidavit. They will do this. But we have to do an MOU in KSDL. Memorandum of Understanding. After that they will come and take these and they will give us a loan. We have to pay the loan to KSDL. They will do all the dressing and they will grade this. They will grade it, dry it and then fix the rate. Oh, this is fixed after the factory is opened? Yes. Then in the coming days we are very optimistic. From now on, the government will not give. We have to give the opportunity to the R&L. How will the payment be? For example, if KSDL takes the loan? After taking the loan, they will give the payment of 10% immediately. Immediately after submission. After the vehicle is opened? Yes. They will give us 20% when it is dry. Then we need a month to dry it. We need a month for that. After a month, we will pay the remaining amount. This is the type. So, 20% is given in advance and 80% is settled. After it is dry, it is settled. So, when it is dry, it is known the quality of the product? Yes. There are many advantages in this. From the market point of view. Even others, immediately after purchasing they will pay the payment. They will pay the payment. But, we are not asking for the private interest. We are asking for the interest. Because, a person who has given a place for a year and given shelter to the animals when he is also in a financial crisis the government should also give him a place to stay. But, will KSDL give the payment? Yes, they will. All the episodes of Kalamadhyam are brought to you by Kalamadhyama YouTube Channel. Subscribe to the channel. Click the bell icon.

He knew me very well about the work of Devaraj Reddy Chitradurga and water conservation. He is from Kaveri. He has done a work called Rukhsha Datru, which has brought 25,000 birds to our district. He has not only brought these birds here, but also provided them with shelter. They are getting sheltered here. They are getting sheltered here. When I heard the sound of birds singing in the rain, I felt like I was in a forest. The reason was that 25,000 birds were not here. The birds spread the birds in lakhs of villages in the nearby villages. In Kurubareli, a small country named Kurubereli was established. After that, they turned it into a forest. Travelers who came to viticulture visited this field andую So, during climate change, river parallel personages were introduced here. Inundation we did through this year. I took care of this too. And even doing it is very important between! In Chitradurga district, we have been working for 8 years to get the government's permission to build the Chitradurga district.

SandalWoodNewsStories_295.mp3:  Welcome to our channel. Please subscribe to our channel and press the bell icon to get the latest updates. Welcome to our channel. India used to be a rich country in ancient times. India was a natural reserve for the people. At present gold it is among the prime reserves of the earned Staff 47 years ago.ений India's gold deposit was very poor in society till today. They had an interesting issue no how there was a red gem in the sand Jonah-th there. This crown trướcere another table and with the same Rose that naïve mistress inteleration the other top. is only found in South India. In that, the best and most prosperous blood-scented trees are only found in the rest of Andhra Pradesh. More than the most beautiful trees in South India, this blood-scented tree is most famous. As mentioned earlier, in the world of earth, this tree is the only visible, invisible and hard-working tree in our India. If you ask the price of this blood-scented tree, you will definitely be shocked. Yes, this blood-scented tree, which was used to make a living due to the destruction of the forest, costs 20,000 to 30,000 rupees. From the tree of a badly grown blood-scented tree, you will get 20 to 30 kg of trees. If you smuggle this, you will get up to 6 lakhs from one tree. So, even if one ton of blood-scented tree is not there, it costs 2 crores. For this reason, this blood-scented tree is also considered a special portion for the safety of the tree. Friends, why is this blood-scented tree so thick? You can ask. Since ancient times, our ancestors used to drink blood-scented in Ayurveda. Later, it was used for skin diseases. As time goes by, the strength of this blood-scented tree in India has increased with the development of science. So, it is used for various modern medicines, and also for the use of beautiful objects. The cost of the most expensive objects is very high. For example, take petrol. In some countries, the cost of petrol is very low in Thailand. But in India, petrol is less, so petrol and diesel are less in our country. The same situation is with blood-scented trees. Blood-scented trees are only found in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. From here, most of the trees are used for foreign countries. Therefore, China is not only the source of this blood-scented tree, but also the source of this blood-scented tree. Because, China uses this blood-scented tree in the fields and other places. China is not the only one. You know that India has also come to the knowledge that Ayurveda has been used to treat diseases caused by medicines. So, in such Ayurvedic medicines, blood-scented trees are also used. In the same way, in other countries, blood-scented trees are also used. For this reason, the tree of this blood-scented tree is more popular in China. In China alone, blood-scented trees are used in Japan and Mongolia for the use of various medicines. Friends, if these medicinal properties are excluded, China will not like this blood-scented tree, which is another reason. About 700 years ago, during the 14th century, the Ming dynasty ruled China. For the last 100 years, the Chinese and the Chinese people have been living in China. According to a report published by the British newspaper China Daily, the Ming dynasty was obsessed with the blood-scented petal-patterns and such disgusting things prepared by the royal family. At that time, the royal family could not find the blood-scented tree anywhere, so they were taking it from there. It is said that they were disgusting the royal family with the furniture and the disgusting things. The blood-scented tree was used to make the house dirty. The royal family was not interested in the house because it was a house that was made by the royal family. It was used to keep the house clean and the house was made by the royal family to make it clean. These things were used to keep the house clean and the house was made by the royal family. Even if the royal family got rid of this dirty thing, the royal family could not get rid of the dirty thing. Despite the fact that the blood-scented tree was used to clean the house, the royal family was not interested in the dirty things In the forest of Sheshachalam, the killing of the trees began. Then, the poor workers go to the forest, cut down the trees, and earn money by selling the trees to the smugglers. Some smugglers use the trees to kill the smugglers and then kill them. These workers are always against any kind of crime. The police officers are not interested. It is wrong to say that the former Pushpa king who ran the kingdom of Rajarosh is the killer. The tree is 11 meters tall and grows up to 8 to 11 meters. This tree is also important because it is the time to grow. Yes, if the normal tree grows up to 10 years, it takes 30 years for a poor tree to grow up to a tree of blood. But, If the normal tree grows up to 10 years, it will grow up to a tree of blood. First of all, the blood of this tree is a must in the international market. Because of this, the government spends crores of rupees every year on these trees for the safety of the forest. In the next 2.5 lakh hectares, the part of this Sheshachalam forest will be very important. Because the smugglers who do the smuggling of the blood are not smugglers. First of all, the smugglers are supplying the blood of Rs. 20,000 crores every year. For this, the people who do the smuggling of these trees are punished with 15 years of imprisonment. Here, the blood of the smugglers is a question for the forest officials. The forest officials are not the ones who do the smuggling of the blood. So, you may ask, why is this tree, which is the most powerful tree in the world, a blood tree? There is no answer to this. There is a tree that is much more precious than a blood tree. That is African Blackwood. Yes, if you ask the price of this tree, you will be surprised. This tree is worth more than every kg of the international tree. It is worth 8,000 pounds per kg. African Blackwood is the most unique tree on earth. This tree is about 20 to 40 feet tall. African Blackwood is found in 26 countries of Central and South Africa. This unique tree, which is most common in the desert area, is more prosperous and lasts for 60 years. But in the countries of Kenya and Tanzania, where the blackness of this tree is the most common, this tree is the most common. Therefore, this unique tree is in the state of destruction. African Blackwood is also used to make music like music, drums and guitar. Besides this, the most precious and childhood memories of this tree are also preserved. This tree, which was caught in the dock where beings live, is now also in the state ofSC Action. America is arison? No. You must love Africa. They are called African Blackwood. What happened to Africa in South Africa to this day? THANK YOU
SandalWoodNewsStories_305.mp3:  So we can earn around 1,20,000 Rupees In a private market, this tree weighs around 10-15,000 Rupees per Kg This depends on the variety of trees and the water and nutrition If we see here, this tree is growing well because it is 5 feet tall and has been properly planted Greetings to all Srikanth is a very valuable tree This tree is famous for its fragrance in the whole world This tree is very popular in the national and international markets But this tree which is so popular is falling short of the market Why? Because the cultivation practice of this tree is correct What Srikanth tree is? We call it as Hemiroot parasite That means This tree is a berry tree The structure of the tree and its production are not developed correctly This tree depends on another tree So if you are growing Srikanth, you need to find a host plant for that The reason why the trees of Srikanth tree are properly cultivated is It does not have the capacity to be water, minerals or nutrients This depends on the water and nutrition of the tree So what kind of tree can be a host for this tree? First of all, we can host agroforestry trees Or any other trees like Mulberry And we can also host other trees that are in good condition Whichever host plant you select, it will be a host plant for Srikanth tree So we can also host other trees that are in good condition So the reason why we can host these trees is Because in Srikanth, the heartwood is very important So if the heartwood and oil are to be formed Then the sun light and the heat are required So if we select a very hot tree, it gives a good shade Then the heartwood formation is not possible So in that, we call Srikanth as a stress loving plant That means This tree is stressed If the heat is too much or the heat is too much Then it will grow well at that time I said earlier that if there is a heartwood formation or oil formation Then the heat should be more and the heat should be more So if we get all these things, this tree will grow well If you want to plant a host plant for this Srikanth tree Distance is very important That means, if you plant a host plant, You have to plant a host plant after 2.5 to 3.5 meters If you want to plant a very good host plant for this Srikanth tree Which is a leguminous plant, then you can use a host plant for this tree. You can call it a leguminous plant These leguminous trees Because they are the main source of the environment They are the main source of the environment So this tree can be used for the The host plant comes in two types One is a primary host and the other is a permanent host Primary host means If this tree is a good one If it is in the starting stage Then it should be given for 2 years from 6 months Next is a permanent host Then it should be given for 2 years from 6 months If we see what this primary host is It is a Togari, Muttidharai Muni and Sesbeniya If we see what this primary host is It is a Togari, Muttidharai Muni and Sesbeniya If we are a secondary host, then it is a permanent host We can plant a Hippunerala tree We can plant a Teak We can plant a Hunne We can plant other sweet trees We can also plant Glirisedia By planting Glirisedia and Sesbeniya More population is produced in the soil That means, these two trees Because they are small trees, More population is produced in the soil This is also very important This is also very important If you want this to grow If you want this to grow Another important part This tree is a rain-reinforced tree This tree should never be planted in a water area This tree should never be planted in a water area Why? I told you earlier In this tree, if there is a formation of Heartwood or oil content There should be more light and moisture If not, if there is more water the quality of the oil content will also be very low. If you want to grow a host plant for Shree Gandha Mara, the plants should not depend on water too much. It should also be grown in the rainy season. Because when you give more water to that plant, it will also affect Shree Gandha. If you want to grow Shree Gandha Mara, the soil is also very important. Since it depends on the host plant, we have to give about 5 feet of space to the host and Shree Gandha Mara. If you give more than 5 feet of space, this tree will not connect with the other tree. It is very difficult to grow water and nutrition plants at that time. In this same garden, we will also show that example. If you see here, because the space is 5 feet, this tree is growing well. If you see in this garden, if you see a tree there, it will not grow well. Because the distance between the host plant and the tree is very long, it is not growing well because the plant is not taking the water and nutrition properly. We call this Shree Gandha Mara as a wider adaptability crop. Because, no matter what kind of soil or soil it is, this tree can grow easily. This Shree Gandha Mara, can grow up to 160 trees by giving 10 feet of distance to each tree. This tree will grow for about 15 to 20 years. So, from one tree, we get about 20 kg of hardwood. In this market rate, we get about 6000 rupees per kg of this tree. So, if we take about 20 kg from one tree, we can earn about 1 lakh 20 thousand rupees. So, if one acre is 160 trees, we can get about 2 kg of hardwood from 160 trees. In that, we can add papaya to this Shree Gandha Mara, we can add lime, we can add turmeric, we can add cinnamon, we can add this kind of trees, we can get about half of that. But, all these are for the benefit of the Shree Gandha Mara, if we want to grow this Shree Gandha Mara, the most important problem is, this will become a stone. So, we can take this tree as a stone. So, we have to give protection to this tree. Since this Shree Gandha Mara is not being produced, and because of the increase in the production of this tree, the government is also supporting the construction of the Shree Gandha Mara. The government of Karnataka has also done a project called Grow More Sandalwood, to build this tree. To protect this tree, first of all, we have to use microchips to protect this tree. If you see how, to protect this Shree Gandha Mara, the government has this protection system. What this means is, by using microchips, we can protect the trees. How this is done is, we can dig 8 feet deep from the ground, and we can put the microchip in the trees. This is done by Indian Wood Science and Technology. So, what happens is, if a stone comes to your garden, what happens is, there is a drone, night vision camera, day vision camera, when someone comes to your garden, it captures the images in the camera. What is this microchip? There is a server in it, one server is connected to Indian Wood Science and Technology. If someone comes to your garden, they also get a signal there. When you cut the tree and take it, what happens is, you can even track the stone. But, if you want to dig in your garden, you have to put at least 100 Sri Gandha trees in your garden. But, if you want to do all this, depending on the government, what you can do is, you can dig a deep hole around it. In this deep hole, because the stone is very thick, it is not easy to dig it out. So, those trees, if you dig about 40 to 50 feet, Sri Gandha trees can be seen even from the side of the road. So, you can also use other types of fencing, like using a stick, or using a barbed wire to fence a tree. So, by doing this, we can protect the trees. So, if you bury dogs in your garden, they also protect the trees. So, you can install a CCTV camera. Since there are many people who are against this tree, the government has also given a lot of support. So, if you want to buy a tree, you can buy this tree from Aranya Ilaka for 3 to 5 rupees per seedling. So, through the Sri Gandha scheme, you can get help for the construction of this tree. In addition, you can get insurance for the construction of this tree. Not only that, there is also a social security. So, all the farmers in the village can give protection to this tree by building this tree. So, you can get this tree in any way you want. This tree is adapted to all environmental conditions. So, if you grow this tree in your garden, you can grow more trees. Thank you. Since Dr. Sahil started, the number of posts is increasing. So, my number has increased.
