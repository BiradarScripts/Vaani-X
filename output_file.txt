Thogri how many years ago? one year later then this is it this is the first year it is growing well it is growing well it is growing well you can see all this we should give another year this is 3 and half years 4 years you can see the growth now consider it as almost 4 years it is not completed but within 4 years it is a good growth for this we will give another host we will plan for stress management because growth should be good and heart would be good if there is excess growth heart would be bad reason is tissues will not break down second metabolism is to develop tissues and heart would be good and we should have constant stress consistency means every day you should get stress every time if there is a small drop after 12 years if you have target to cut then there is a chance for heart would be problem that is why it is extremely healthy it is good in the initial stage but how to maintain it is wrong so we will discuss about secondary metabolism we will discuss about it see this is the very first time this is the first time this is the first time this is the first time what these plants have done is simple what they do is sandal drains extreme nutrients means at least 15 calculate so that is a very difficult task to maintain good so you need active nutrients so how many plants are there I might have to mention This is the mother of the bird Basically this is the nest For this, we are planning to give a permanent host We have given some vermi compost One advantage is that it has grown for a year It has grown for 3-4 feet Left and right After a year, we have given the nest After a year, the nest After pruning, it has become small After pruning, we have given it For the root zone, you have not given anything? No, we have not given anything We have given irrigation in the summer In June, July, August, we have given water In the summer, we have given water In the summer, we have given water But what I am saying is Leaf density is very low If you want to know the difference between the two Look at this side This side has more leaves than this side If you look here, you will definitely have photosynthesis activity This side has more leaves It is a time-consuming place If you look here, you will see the growth It will be very bad The size of the leaf will be big Length and other things are not comparable So, if you are lucky, now Boost up the soil a little Boost up the soil Do you know the size of the leaf? The leaf has dropped a little Here, it has dropped the leaf completely Okay In one year, all this will be gone Yes sir It will be gone to Malabar It has almost gone It has almost gone It will take some time to grow If you cut it now, it will grow again Yes, yes It is not enough to grow It will not grow that much Okay But It will take some time to grow What is it sir?

The answer is light Light is very important If you want to grow a tree It is very important to plan from the first For the farmer That is why we are doing this video The second reason is The next host will not be able to grow You are seeing There This is our This is our This is our This is how beautifully it has grown with our banyan Two reasons One Because the banyan tree is a big tree Because of this In a small way It will get nutrients It will get strength in a small way Because of the strength of the banyan tree It has grown one feet for three years If the farmer tries it This is the last number I always say Do not cut the banyan too much In the field It is not important to cut a thousand banyans It is not important Cut it to ten banyans Or a hundred banyans It can be sized well Otherwise, it can fall down in a good way Okay So, the purpose of doing this video for the farmers is To help the farmers with a small knowledge The banyan tree has nutrients and host Count three main Don't go above the number Don't do it like you have to put 500 or 600 acres They have put an acre of 400 acres There is no result Because it is a tree And then the host is dying I will tell you to remember this Come to continue this video Aha Now the micro nutrients are DAP If you leave it, it will not give anything Now it is called DAPS It is given for a year It is given for planting time Planting time There is nothing after that

After two years, 20 people were killed in the STF shootout. But, the work of the bloodshed was not over. The bloodshed in the Aranya region was not over. If the bloodshed in the Aranya region was to be transferred to other kingdoms, they had to plan it properly. They had to collect the stolen gold on one side. That place was the Kattigaanahalli. Kattigaanahalli's 9th general had a lot of knowledge about the bloodshed. First, he had to dig up the bloodshed and then trade it in the village houses.

There will be no chance of termites or fungus. So we will add some fungicide. After adding fungicide, we will mix it with water and spray it. This will give you some protection. When you add fungicide, you should not add it in the primary host. This is important to remember. You can take it in the primary host or you can add it in the plant. I have mentioned it, right? One can. You should not add it in the primary host. The plant will not grow. It will not be able to grow. The plant will not be able to grow. What is the role of the primary host?

Connections will come and so the plant will still be alive. The plant has בת taken a root. You know about the symptoms. When you are done, you will lift the thugiza. You will keep the ... ... 5-6 intervals here. S uniquely here about a month. These are saxamara. Next. Casuarina, Surveyor and Nukya These three trees grow very fast because after the primary host is gone, the secondary host starts to connect If you look at the three trees, all the trees are connected None of the trees are connected to this tree So the root connection of the trees around us comes from these three trees The tree starts to grow If you want to suppress the tree, you have to prune the tree Cut the tree and control the growth Is there any advantage of one species of tree? There are advantages of one species of tree But if you have other trees with different nutrients and advantages, it will be good So in Kolar, the nation is very good So in Kolar, the nation is very good The nation has grown Please subscribe! if you are in a distance of 5 metres from one tree, there will be a space in between in this space, you can grow papaya or any other fruit that you can grow in a year or two you can grow any crop that is grown locally you can grow any crop that is grown in your area you can grow it but it is not necessary because you can grow it in an unwanted way you can grow it in a tractor and maintain it for 5 years till then you can grow it in a cover ground and grow it in a different place you can grow any other crop like this you can grow any other crop usually sandal is suited for dry land mostly so i have made a slide in this way you can grow a lot of trees you can grow a lot of trees and soil now the question arises, sir can you grow cup soil now the question arises, sir can you grow cup soil now the question arises, sir can you grow cup soil they have made sandals for cup soil but what is the use of sandals there is a lot of clay in the sandals when the clay is a little dry, cracks are formed these cracks are caused by the air that is exposed to the wood when the air is exposed to the wood, the wood will become weak it will become weak then the growth will become weak then the growth will become weak so for that what is done is when there is a lot of clay in the cup soil when there are cracks in the soil the crack is moved by operating a plowing disc these things are given irrigation these things are managed by the management but when it comes to cup soil, the problems do not occur this is for your information next one more line is here this line is between the lines in this line 5 meters to 5 meters is there So if you are growing this crop, you should also prepare a nimband in the same way Because this crop will go beyond the roots The roots of that crop will be removed So the nimband root will also go to this Supply of nutrients So if the nimband is removed, the nimband will be safe for the next 5 years That is why the report is shown here Is it clear? Yes, it is clear Sir, I am saying that you should not grow any other plant It should be sandless Do you understand? Because that plant will not lose its nutrients But sand will lose its nutrients That is the first point The plant will not be in the same condition Because the soil is sanded Do you understand? So why should we supply nutrients to the soil that is sanded? Look at that It has been 5 years and 6 years The nimband is growing The surrounding trees will not stop growing In between the 4-5 years of growing, the nimband will not be in the same condition So if you are growing something for 5 years If you are producing something for 5 years The nimband will not be in the same condition So you should give a permanent host to the 4-5 years of growing The permanent host may be a mango or a big tree Or any other plant that is in the same condition for 5-10 years Or any other high yielding dwarf variety Select those and prepare Do you understand? If you are growing any forestry crops If you are growing timber maran When the timber maran is sanded It will not be in the same condition So the primary product of the timber maran is wood And the primary product of the timber maran is wood So the two are in the same condition So it is a competition Yes it is a competition If you are growing a tree For example, in Srinivaspur You have a variety of maran and arcan If you are growing a tree If you are growing a tree You will be giving 10 kg of wood There is no problem There is no problem There is no problem There is no problem If you are growing fruit The yield will be low But if you are growing this There is no problem But when you are growing tree crops The yield will be low There is another one It is a Myriadu I have shown you the Myriadu On the other side Because if you take the Myriadu It will take 4-5 years to grow But making myriadu could not be done It would need many years to get ready And a sandalwood needs a silver The sandalwood needs silver That makes it wet With just that mud Then a sandalwood is ready If sandalwood has the required material That can be used Di entwickelt To grow achieve this It gives beautiful water At low water So all these problems are there, management is very important For that, we have a concept that the tree is not a jungle tree, it is not a tree that is not protected by the sun We have a concept like this, we have to reduce the tree to that concept The tree is very sensitive, you should not even damage the bark The bark is a protective layer, if you stop the bark, there is a higher chance of it getting into the house That's why you should be careful Even if yourゴ الخ country is 5 meters puede стоя When the branch is over there, if the tractor movements go there, they can Jason are over there If it able to stop the tractor400000 If feel a huge damage, no one will be able to be next to it If that會 damage you can stop there Have you heard of NAMM 때문에 plantation, have you ever heard of Job competition Has anyone heard right?

But, when we started to face this problem, we took a U turn to see what happened. We had arrested the person who was following us. We had followed those bikes. Those bikes had gone to the gate of the same building. We had parked the bike on the side of the car. They had parked the bike on the side of the bike. At the same time, there was a man who was standing there. He was a policeman. He said, please don't go near that village. We were shocked to hear the reason for that. We stopped to tell the story of that village. We had stopped at the same place. We had stopped at the same place. Is it? It was a little dangerous. It was very dangerous. How did you get hurt? I was badly hurt inside. It happened like that. I was hurt there. No, it was not us. We had come there last night. We were observing the situation. Today, we are not there.

In those places… In the moment of being connected to the Delhi road, We would have become lakhs of people Our Cab in Purnima. We are in a position like that. Around the border, we definitely Unable to connect on road and our car whenegoing. We might not be able to change anymore. they are changing the board wow wow this is K27 after half a kilometer it will be K37 nice after 12 borders it will be Tamil Nadu after 12 borders it will be number 3 they will not say number 3 police will not go there don't touch police will not come they will come but this village is like a village if you are a villager you will be able to understand the face of the village Nandarapolice planned to take a village to West Indra they planned and took it this village is not good because of media and police they are saying that people around the village this was an old constable police teachers감 단 bedeutet to understand the police are arresting us The cover story is standing in front of the building. When the police is seen in front of the building, they say that they are trying to harm us. They say that they will take courage and take the village to the ground. What village is this? Why is the lock on? Who is this? This is the village officer. Why is he here? All these are smugglers. All these are frauds. All these people are smugglers. I have doubt about them. If you have doubt, why are you running? They are the ones who are in jail. They are coming and going. They are normal. They say that they are running and looking for us. I have come to this place. Why are they here? They are coming from the government inspectorate. They are coming to us. Why are they here? Why are the Karnataka police running? Why are they here? I will write this in the newspaper. The politicians are the criminals. In a village like Karnataka, if all these acts and crimes were happening, the police would have been silent. If the police are still against this village, there is nothing more to be ashamed of. Is this a witness to the police's murder? Or did they tie their hands to the place where they knew everything? When they thought about it, the politicians have come forward for the votes that have been lost. When the police went to arrest them, they were the same politicians who said to come back. When they were arrested, they were the same politicians who said to leave. If there were politicians who did such a heinous job for the vote bank, if such mini-Pakistanis would come forward and ask why the separation was made, there would be no surprise. Now, leave your dirty politics. Fix this mess. Break the red sandals that are being worn here. Free the hands of the police. Next week, we will be back with another ROTAKA story.

His hard work is what we are doing today. is what we are doing today. If he himself had to work hard, if he had to work hard, he could have grown 3 acres of land in 4 acres of land. I am not saying that he can't grow 100 acres. He can grow 1 fourth of that land. He can grow 1 fourth of that land. He can grow 1 fourth of that land. He is not a big farmer. If he can, then he can grow 1 fourth of that land through the same, means he can't grow 2 thirds of that land now but slowly, he will be able to graduate. Now, he will not do that in 10 years. Now, by using 1 third of that land, he will have a land of areas that are not accessible first. The fewest area needs to beoked slightly. He will not need the land to certain으로 for which we had only 2 arctures. I don't have a big pocket, but I have dreams. That gives me strength. I have a very big pocket. You don't have dreams? No, I don't get tired at 9 o'clock. I sleep with alarm. I don't have any dreams. I don't have any important dreams. I had dreams. I used to wake up at 1 o'clock in the morning, and wake up at 5 in the morning. Dreams give me strength. Dreams make me strong. I have a dream visa. I have a long distance relationship with my friends. From the bottom of the group, there are many friends. They come and fight with me. Every month, on Wednesday, we have a group discussion. They are all about agriculture. They are all about do's and don'ts. Every month, on Wednesday, at 9 o'clock in the morning, we have a discussion about agriculture. We have a discussion about agriculture. We have a discussion about agriculture. We give them information and show them the methods. We feed them with tiffin. We have a free of cost. Every month, on Wednesday, at 9 o'clock in the morning. They come and fight with me. I have a dream visa. If you have a 4-acre land, you can grow 3 acres of land. Out of 4 acres, you can do agriculture with 1 acre. You can do seed production with 3 acres. You can grow oil, vegetables, and do floriculture. You can do anything. You can do anything. You can grow vegetables, fruits, and other things. You can grow butter fruit, and other things. If you grow 300 acres, it will take 15 to 20 years to grow. It will be like a medium. We have discussed this. If you grow 10 acres of oil, and if there is a 4% oil content, it will take 10,000 kgs. 10 kgs. 1 lakh per person. 300 per person. 3 crores. If you think about it, if you give 3 crores to the state bank, and if you come to our family, if you come to our family with any difficulties, if you come to our family with any difficulties, you will get economic strength. The day goes on. 6 years, 8 years. Then, you will get a land gain. You will get a message from the society that you have been growing oil for 8 years. You will get a message from the society that you have been growing oil for 8 years. After 10 years, you will get a CC camera, dogs, a small dog, a small dog, a small dog, and you don't even need to import the dog. You don't need anything. You can just tie a dog to the camera, and put it around the house. Live fencing and windbreaker. It will take 15 years, 16 years, it will be cut, 3 crores will come. I will give you a currency. 1 crore is a good money cut. For our small people. For the self-respect, for the dignity, for the character, for the life of our children, our parents, our parents, we need that money. For a crore's house. A quality life. A self-respecting life. We need that. That is the real value we need. 1 crore is a money cut. If you give 50 lakhs, you will get 1 kg gold. If you give 1 kg gold to a cow, you will get 1 kg gold. If our cow becomes 1 kg gold, you need a message. Why I am saying this is because, if they do farming, they will not get any profit. Yes. But we are growing vegetables, what? We are growing wheat. We are growing rice. We are growing wheat from Koti Vidya. We are growing wheat from Jai Vagali, Jai Javan, Jai Kisan. But what is happening in reality is, they will not get any profit because they are farming. They will not get any profit. So, we need to change that. How to change that? We need to understand this. If our cow becomes 1 kg gold, all the other cows will be dead. If the other cow is also a cow, I will also become 1 kg gold. I will also become 1 kg gold. We need a message. 1 crore's house, 1 kg gold for 50 lakhs. Don't make a profit of 50 lakhs. FD the children's work. Don't be afraid of making a profit of 1 crore. Make a profit for the children. Give good quality education to the children. Give good quality education to the children. Children will become a good asset. 2 crores. Give 1 crore more. Do good business. Do good farming. Don't be a bad person. Don't be a bad person. Don't go to any leader's house. One is for MLM, another is for MP. May be booze, White pant or Ingbee. If an big Lt roves. If a boy roves. He too will alert the children. Their堪 civic connection with Ivayati, he too will alert the students. Boss, Appaji. They too are capable of that. Ofc they can make 10 crore just for that single lumbar Filmy. Every farmer's work Every blood of his son will be the result of his hard work. Every son should go to the house of the Lord. It is a big sin. No one should be given shelter. No one should go to the house of the leader. We should give support to the animals and the birds. We should give them the responsibility of social responsibility. We should give them the responsibility of social responsibility. And make them financially successful. There is a life of economic, health, and self-respect. There is also a life of spirituality. When he built a hut of trees and made it a temple, and left the mud and the fire to go there, he never went there. You can build your own houses. You can build your own houses. After all that, their motherland. You should not leave it. kı Louisiana This is what is called texts. This is also tried at Near Kyala's temple. They actually ask by using prayers. The small criwa made the sky white and ears myself from on top of the colour of the edges of the soil. And then seven different things. It was written. It blinded him all the time. If you see a eagle, it will drive you to that place and then take you out of that place and become the mother of one's own. It is like a God's ear. Why do we say that agriculture is a property of the poor? Why do we say that the higher education is better than the higher education? This is the same. In this, the spiritual life is the economic, health and ideal. If we have a small land, should we do agriculture even for ourselves? Why should we not do it? It is possible. If we have a big land, should we do it for ourselves? What will our elders say? What will our sages say? What will our darshanikas say? What is better than building a temple? There is a temple for everyone. There is a temple for all. There is a temple for all. But there is nothing for a temple. Who will it give food? Who will it give shelter? Who will it give land? Who will it give caste? So, the one who built a temple, I have done a good deed, I will tell you. So, until you build a temple, you will get the merit of building 100 temples. 100 temples. So, this is one What is this? Every farmer, on our land, if we have 20-10 paise, we can do it. We have to do it. Ok sir. Thank you sir. No, do it. There is no big landlord. We can do it. Because, his family had this. Then, tomorrow, his children will give. Now, we, 40. We have got 82 paise. Now, wherever we have gone, we have gone here, we have gone to Belgaum, we have gone to Dharavada, we have gone to Ubudi. After graduation, we have come here. But, we have gone to all places. We have gone to P.V.C., Degree, 10th, High School. Now, we have gone to all places. We have gone to Sardar Vallabhai Patel, we have gone to Modi, we have gone to all places. We have gone to all places. We have gone to our mother. We have gone to her. We have gone to every son. After doing, there is one side. He has asked, Hey, our father is good. He has lived here. He has lived here. He has lived here. He has lived here. But, if we go there, there is nothing we can do. That one strong man can do it. Good man can build it. That person can be built by any evil powers. This is a farming family, actually, these are a farming family. Because, their every food is fair. So, there is that power in it. So, anytime, no matter how much he is, that Kursika is like that God, he is visible, this is happening. He is being worshipped everywhere. He is worshipping himself everywhere. Don't discuss it too much. All these can lead to a wonderful life. All these problems can be solved. All these rituals, all these can be done by our family members to build a wonderful family.

See, in our country, Bevu, Alasu, Bashiru, Vanni, Ala, Harali, they have brought the wonderful things. That too, it gives the support to the birds, it gives the support to the environment, it gives the support to the earth, it helps the earth to grow, it gives the support to the environment, the earth is growing. But, is this a bird's nest? Is this a bird's nest? Is this a bird's nest? This one? This is the blood moon. Take all these sandals, all these. This is the bird's nest, this is the bird's nest. This is the sandalwood. There is a big one here. If the other one has not a name, it will die. It will die. What is that? This is a Paravalambi Sassi. It is basically a semi-root parasite. It is basically parasitic in nature. Paravalambi? Yes, yes. We need a support for this. Is it? That is why we have brought it here. This is a Paravalambi Sassi. It is basically a semi-root parasite. This is a Kurichalu Sassi. Even though there are big trees, it is called the Chandanada Bheedu in Karnataka and Gandhaga. Because, the wonderful soil, water and air that is available in this place, which is available in the entire world, is here. The Uttakushta Matas Srikanta that comes here does not come anywhere. I am a Srikanta Bhaldi of 100 acres. And this is 5000 acres in our area. 5000 acres? This is India's biggest sandalwood cluster. You can see the sandalwood cluster here. Kopplarajishtik is India's biggest sandalwood cluster. Wow! There are about 3 professors here. They are from Karnataka, Andhra and Tamil Nadu. They are my former PhD students.

They have a place to do conference in the AC room called Global Warming. They have a place to do boot and blazer. A group of people have been here to do hand and leg exercises. They are talking and they are talking. About 1000 acres of forest is being constructed in our area. This is not an ordinary place like Koppala district. From the beginning, this place was a place of prosperity for the whole world. This place has become a place of wealth. From today, the quality of the forest is being produced here. Soaps, cosmetics, perfumes, powder, all the products are produced here. The market for this place is Koppala. It has that much power. We have made Dalimbi a part of the world. This is the land that we have made for the world. This is Dalimbi headquarters? Yes sir. When you see all this, you will see that this is a big Asiatic city. So, this is the world's largest forest. In our Koppala district, there are 5000 acres of forest. We are talking about the same rate. The current rate is 28. Even if we take this rate, we can give you Rs.15000 crores of raw material. That power is in our land. This is the district. Rs.15000 crores of forest is worth products. Yes sir. And, there is economic survival in the land. There is economic survival. There is economics. There is economic survival. We need to live a life of self-respect, a life of virtue, and a life of virtue. We need to have that reality. But, what we call as Sreekanth Adharitha Kurshiyaranya, Sandalwood centric agroforestry model. What do we do with this? There is not only economic survival in this. Along with economic survival, there is also a health survival. There is a life of self-respect. There is a life of spirituality. There is a life of self-respect. There is a life of self-respect as well. What is this? Here, the land itself is a shelter for animals and birds. It gives the environment a shelter. It is social responsibility. If we establish a social job, and survive economically, we are in a state of poverty. That is a power. Why? Our people say, agriculture is a crime against wealth. Why? In the same era, when did we come? What did you say? When the computer came, we came. We came. From the time of the 100s of people, our ancestors, they said that agriculture is a property of the poor. Agriculture is a property of the poor. In the same era, business is a thought of betrayal. But, when it comes to agriculture, how much respect it has. You are now telling the birds to mix. Yes. Here you see, many of the birds of the people are inside. You can see the body inside. Shoes should be there. Here, a garden is built. That means, the land is being built by itself. A social responsibility, to ensure the social responsibility. Why did the corona come today? Why did you get a cold? Why did you get a cold? Why did you get cancer? It is a crime committed by itself. It is not a crime. We have to use the power to stop it. You should study it completely. You should experience the corona coming. The power to fight the corona, we should use that power. We should use that power. This hybrid food, this pollution, this life of the poor, from this, it was to fight it. It was there in the early 1000s. You should study it deeply. You will understand. Corona was there. But we don't have the courage to fight it. We don't have the courage to fight it. We have a lot of things. Even if we get a small problem, we need tablets, we need an earth injection, we need a 5000 rupee expense. When we get that, what happened today? Corona is still coming. What is happening now is, look here, there is no Jeera dust. Yes. I was talking about this with our brother Rasool. Before you came here. Here, there is no Jeera dust. If you see in Bangalore, in Koppala district, there is a fire, there is a flood, there is a flood, there is a flood, there is no water, there is no water, there is no water. That is wrong. We are creating a Malayalee by giving the earth a smell. We are all, we have a complete group. We need to build a forest in Bishile. We need to build a forest in Bharatanadu. That forest should be a smelly forest. It should be a sea-scented bed. Yes. There is possibility. Because it is a very native species of us and it is a very adaptable species. That means? It will come to us easily. Yes sir. And also, if there is no special technology for this it will grow one by one. Oh. There is no need for any big bando. Now, we have heard that you can get a few comments when you broadcast this on YouTube. That this is a waste, this and that. Yes. There are exaggerated figures. Yes, they are exaggerating. There are so many people like that. Always, a strong belief, self-confidence, and a strong interest on work. That is required. I will talk to you quietly, nothing will happen. I need to do something. I need to do something. One thing is, we have seen it all. A big gentleman in any state, in any big institution, he is not getting an IAS. He is getting a rank for his work in a temple. He is getting an IAS pass. Why? Strong belief, self-confidence, and a strong interest on work. That consistent effort is required. Oh. So, what is happening now is, Sri Ganda, we are the second generation of farmers. Our father, Dalembe. Dalembe farmer, he has made a financial contribution. Devendrapa Baluti. He is the head of this area. He is the head of National Dalembe Farmer Association. National Farm Grant Growers Association. He is the vice president. He has made a significant financial contribution. But, who can take a grill with the wrong land, that person, can get a myriad of типа. What can i say, beyond this, bridha bilat who can take a grill with a strong belief, he shows acquired skills, for this. He should work hard, for one or two K.s. I dont say this so excessively We have done that. He has been 나가í on Farm Gags. Farm Gargs. He has worked on it. I am doing this only. I am not doing this to say that I can do farming in the field of vegetables. It is not possible. I don't need anything like that. I am doing this project only. I am doing this project only. Step by step. I have planted plants and plants in the field of vegetables. There are no water sources. There is no borewell. I am doing this wonderfully. But even in the middle of this, I am planting Sri Gandha. But this is not something that we can do easily. This is a land of sand. This is a land of sand. But in addition to this, in the field of agriculture, there is a huge effort. You know the name of the plant. Sandalwood oil. A quality Sri Gandha oil. Today KSDL Moisu sandal. KSDL Retailing. 5 grams and 10 grams. Two packing. Half a bag and one bag. One bag is 5000. 10 grams. Because, we need a basis. Today, one bag of Sri Gandha is 5000 rupees. 10 grams. 10 grams is 5000. 100 grams is 5000. One kilogram of Sri Gandha is today, Karnataka government is increasing in Karnataka itself. The rate of 5 lakh rupees per kg. We should know this. Today, Karnataka government is increasing in Karnataka itself. One kilogram of Sri Gandha is 5 lakh rupees. That is increasing in our day, in our eyes, in our ears. That means, what is increasing now, is it increasing in the whole world? It is not a problem of disease or disease. That means, we are following that method. That is the rule. When we are following that method, we are not giving any advantage to this. But, because of this, we will understand one thing. When we take a project in the management, we will see the strength. What is the strength of that project? We have done SWOT analysis. We have done SWOT analysis. We have strength, weakness, opportunities and threats. Now, there are no threats. Threats are a challenge. SWOT became SWAK. Challenge. If we look at this standard routine, there is a challenge. Protection. Because it has a great power. What is that sir? Great power. It is not a problem. Sir, what happened is, in the government world, all the properties, all the property, but none of them are there. Government. What a great opposition. Office. All of them. Tax office. Government hospital. All of them. Government hospital. Hey, why? Our property. All of them. But none of them are there. They eat there and they live there. Do they live at their house? See, the hospital. How much it is built, how nice it is. All the properties are destroyed. That is why, it is related to this. That type of nature. What is happening now is, if there is a public place, no one has a job there. That is a public place. Public. Public property. But what is happening here, you have come here, I will give you my Aadhar number. You have covered around 3 cameras. What is the camera in us? If your eyes are connected to that camera, your Aadhar number will come. The technology has developed so much. Now, technology has developed so much, the market has developed so much.

We will do what we know to do. Yes. If anything happens to me, even here the farmers will be experienced. If anything happens to me, what will happen to me, it will be in our hands. We will see. So, this is a very high risk, there is a return. High risk, high returns. No risk, no returns. Both will go equally. What is happening is, because there is a price, the color is shown. There is no price, it is not there. So, we have to take a complete process. We have to give knowledge there. Now we have the opportunity. There is a military knowledge. A very high military knowledge. Now we can put cameras, sensors, traps, dogs. Then we can do fencing. Fencing is not to be built as a compound. I will show you a bamboo shop. It is a bed.

SandalWoodNewsStories_43.mp3:  Hi India, Today I am in Bangalore. Actually, the rarest of rare person personality we are interviewing today regarding sandalwood. Actually, in recent days, sandalwood is booming. You all know that. So, the rarest of rare person I came to Bangalore to interview. So, we have Anantha Padmanabhan here. Hello Sir. Hello. So, we came to interview him. Actually, he is the father of sandalwood. So, we will learn some tips regarding sandalwood cultivation and nursery from him. So, come. Sir, what is your opinion regarding sandalwood? Like our viewers. Regarding sandalwood, I have received a lot of messages. I have seen that in Karnataka, there is a sandalwood shop. Now, there is a Durga Sandalwood shop. Because, our sandalwood production is very low. In 1975, we were producing 5000 tons of sandalwood from 4 to 5 thousand tons. Now, the situation is such that, the total quantity of sandalwood is about 250 tons. And, no one is selling oil. So, the Karnataka shoppers, they need about 70 to 80 tons of sandalwood per year. So, they take oil and use it. So, no one is selling it. If this situation happens, our country will be completely destroyed. So, the forest department has not taken much responsibility. In Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and other places, the Karnataka forest department has not taken much responsibility. So, the demand for sandalwood is very high. If we want to meet the demand, we need to participate in private activities. We need to make sure that all the private owners also produce sandalwood. If this is done, it will definitely help the sandalwood industry. Sir, should the private industry take any permission? Or, should everyone produce sandalwood? No one has been allowed to produce sandalwood. So, in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the forest department has made an amendment. In 2000, or 2000, according to this amendment, anyone can produce sandalwood. The sandalwood is produced there. The sandalwood is produced there and declared as their own property. But, to make it a part of the business, the forest department has to take the responsibility. The forest department has to take the responsibility. It is a very strict policy. We have not worked with the private landowners. They don't have any rights. The forest department has given us the certificate of the landowner. We are not working with the agricultural producers. We are working with the forest department. We are working with the landowner. We are working with the forest department. We are working with the landowner. Ellazhin Decreased the den Alfred Roenck The landowner says, how did you get me into forest Sk excellency? That landowner says, The landowner says, how did you get me into the forest!" Everyone feels that the landowner is slightly braided. Fresh sand. These, if taking another approach, may become the province. Hence by determining these rules, Dr. Ganesh is making great progress. Although he is somewhere known and versuchen to keep him, because of the same chce and of his status as a government in India, his situation is also very retiredse that is why he could not reach open access to this. Hence by developing these rules and policies, we are aiming to develop these policies. I heard that Karnataka Govt is supporting this. What are the rules for each state? Or will all the states have the same rules? No, even the rules are the state subject. Each state has its own rules. After the Ganda, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra, no state has any rules on the Ganda. They will change it. Only Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have these rules. Sir, one more thing. Actually, people are talking about seeds. First, the question is, how to get permission to plant seeds. So, many people are getting down there. They are saying that they don't want to plant sandalwood. Another step is, which seed should be planted, which is the best. This is a very common doubt. What is your opinion? Which seed should be planted? According to the old forest system, the tree should be planted well, and the seeds should not be taken. That is a pure mistake. Because, when a tree is planted with a flower, when the flower is planted with a plant, it should be planted reproductively. Okay sir. So, we have not stopped for 22 years. It is coming in 4 years, it is coming in 5 years. We have collected the seeds. We have to cultivate it and use it. Oxford Dictionary has not applied PRR. What they have applied is, when a tree starts to bloom, it will be reproductively matured. So, if it is reproductively matured, it can't be cultivated sweetly. Then a tree should be planted in a shower or direct out, then it develops to decay and then it calms in the sun. Then a tree becomes donut. People should not grow sweetness in a shower. So, she الت怒�jesu kam engine We can use this seed for growing vegetables. So, we can grow any type of vegetables. Sir, I have taken seeds from IWST. When I took it, I compared it with the seeds sold in the market. IWST seeds are actually available. But the seeds sold in the market are very small. So, what is the difference? We have studied seeds and made them into three types. One is small, medium and the other is big. We have made them into three types. Even if we take the medium size, it will be good. We have also taken seeds from the fields and dried them. We have dried them. We have dried them. We have taken seeds from the fields and dried them. So, we can get good germination. We can get good germination from small and big seeds. So, the assumption is that if we take the big seeds, we can get good germination. No, that is wrong. If we take the big seeds, we can get more fatty acid content. If we take the small seeds, we can get less. So, germination has nothing to do with that. So, we can take seeds for 5,000 years. Yes, seeds are grown for 2 years. One is grown in April and the other is grown in September and October. We can take seeds for any season. Sir, you are making seeds for nursery. What is your idea? How many saplings can be grown per kg? In 1 kg of seeds, we can get seeds for 5 to 5,000 years. That is a well-implained seed. 50% of the seeds will definitely get germination. 50% will get germination. If we take seeds, we can get all the seeds in the seed bed. Yes, sir. All approximately, 100 to Own Dates can be ki Ist prayed by the Lord __ The water will definitely come out of the seeds and and we will see a lot of growth in the seeds that have grown at that poplar. We will get starSEED tomatoes. If we use this seedарgo for our999% damage, We can get a huge harvest. We root so many tomatoes we can gives. The first thing we do is spray the fungus and insects. We spray once a day. When we spray, the seeds that we sow do not give any good results. When we sow, we get a fungus called fusarium and a fungus called pithium. Similarly, we get a fungus called nematode. When we mix the nematode and fungus, it will definitely harm the plant. To find out more about this, we mix it with insecticide. We mix it with insecticide. We spray it with insecticide for two weeks. Even if you have this disease, you can easily control it.

I wanted to achieve something in my life. I told my husband that I had a job. I wanted to do something in my life. I was 45 degree Celsius. I didn't have the temperature in Darwada.

Do you know what the banana recommends? we should also have good food we should also have good support and we should also be productive yes, that is the only way to survive how can we survive if we have to take care of the crop for 12-15 years how can we manage our own household for example, if I ask a man who is 18-25 years old what work do you do I will ask him to do farming he will ask me I will get a pension and retirement pension this is the system I have set up agriculture, horticulture, agroforestry and animal husbandry all the combinations yes, all the combinations we have planned and prepared but at that time we will not be able to get down in the farming of Shrikant I have seen that practically I have come to that I have understood that why I am not going to work for Shrikant for 8-9 years come, let us go I will show you what I have done for 9 years, I have not been able to get down in the farming of Shrikant because Shrikant has many responsibilities and responsibilities there is a lot of confusion yes, there is a lot of confusion you can take any work what is the rate of Shrikant what is its future what is its use and results and how can we get a good economic situation we have to understand and understand and get confused we have to find a way I will tell you what I have done for the farmers we have done all the work we have done Ullagadi, Melasiinkai Kabbu, Raggi, Batta we have done everything we have not seen one crore per acre neither we nor anyone have seen that is the truth if we talk about the farm if we talk about the farm you will see that there are not many pictures there is a terrible truth behind this what is the terrible truth you are doing the farm you are not famous in youtube you are not famous in facebook youtube and facebook shows colorful pictures but the farmers are not that colorful it is very terrible what is the terrible thing I will talk about it in a tractor one tractor costs 800 to 900 rupees one cow I will bring one cow it costs 1400 rupees one cow costs 500 rupees one cow costs 300 rupees we do not count the money we have earned because we do not get any we have to earn our own money after doing all these what do we get in the end what do we get in a year because in the olden days they count the amount that is our new year we count the amount what we have spent what we have earned what we have earned we count the amount what we have earned we count the amount because the cost of cultivation is reduced the income is reduced the agriculture is reduced because they are not proportional to each other that is the thought process the people who are in power the prime minister Narendra Modi says that in 2072 we have to divide the land by half if the half is zero it will not be zero it will be double zero if we multiply zero into zero it is zero only it cannot be infinite if we want to make it infinite this is the right time to think over it this is the right time what I say is it is over for us the youth is in your hands because every year people are getting rich the land is getting rich it is not there if we want to make the land rich we have to start it has to be creative because our story is over it is in your hands so today I will tell you what is agroforestry what is the need of the day what is the need because we calculate the MSP what is the minimum support price the minimum what is the supporting price what will you consider you as a government as a people our crops our expenses our oil and cow dung how much will be the cost for the MSP and our land will you be able to buy it you tell me if the land is there you will cultivate it if the land is not there you will be living in cities you will not live in a 500 sq ft one single bedroom where will our land go sir where will our rental charges go sir it is not a way to do it you tell me and no one counts it sir to count it I selected agroforestry I told you sir this is a long term crop I told you sir if we cultivate this for 12 to 15 years our land will be dead till then it is dead dead investment to make the land to be good I was supporting agroforestry because if we cultivate srigandha you know it will not come soon we have to sleep for 15 years if we sleep for 15 years the land will be strong we have to bring the harvest for that I have done peerala, maavu, sitapal today in 8 acres of Hathugunta 2000 srigandha 1000 maavu 600 peerala 600 sitapal 300 neerlan 100 nuggya kaya 100 coconut 800 saagwani gida single square feet of your land should not be wasted it has the value I have done that you may see it practically single square feet of your land should not be wasted I am working on that and I am working on the project try to reduce the cost of cultivation you are wasting your agriculture you spent 10 lakhs and 15 lakhs you are not growing it how much will you get out of 10 lakhs? for a year how much will you spend on that? for that you are wasting the agricultural value you spent 2 lakhs and 5 lakhs then also then also it is profitable then also it is profitable our vision our thinking should be changed I will say if you want to sell your land you can do it for 50rs 50rs is enough I will give you 50rs because you have made 50rs as interest so what I say is earning is not important saving is important for that your land how much you should spend spend it and go with nature go with nature don't go against it go with it and do something for the benefit that is agriculture I am doing the same then water I know the truth where is it? in Rayachur I tried a lot but I didn't get water when I know the weakness of water I will tell you more water rice wheat flour I know the weakness because I have put it in the water then in my crop there is no oil in the water how much water you will use that much oil content will be generated because the farmer of Srikanth has to grow rice in the forest if he grows in the forest it doesn't require special care and maintenance for that for that water for that labour for that in the cost of saving our Karnataka is Srikanth you will do it technically don't go to the water then the help you give what you give it should not be carried by Srikanth because what happens if you carry the help when we are in Srikanth there should be a person next to you if you give the person next to you he should be a person because the sun does not shine it is not possible if the person is in the forest then we can see the sun for that what I say to the farmer if you want to work in the forest I am a pioneer in Srikanth but I will say one thing I have experienced in my 8 to 10 years journey I have experienced a lot I have told this to other farmers I am a farmer I have not given you a block I have dug a hole I have been doing it daily what to do what kind of host management what kind of water management what kind of pest control what kind of nutritional balance how much to give I have been with it I have been doing this that I will tell to my farmers because I feel that I will get that much access No, not at all. Nothing can be grown in the forest. Nothing can be grown in the forest? Nothing can be grown. It has to be covered with mud. You have to be ready for the sun, the sun, the rain, the cold.

You cannot do anything. Because their root is very big. In the case of Balamandi, they remove the stem and then plant it. The roots are 3 feet apart from the stem. The roots contain oil. In Karnataka and Srikanth, 6% of the soil is oil. Whereas in other states, it is not 1 to 2%. I am telling this to everyone in Karnataka. Mother Earth has already given you that God Gift. Nature has already left you behind. But you have to understand. After 7 to 8 years, the soil has not been removed. How can you leave it there? Srikanth's roots are not there. If you take your tractor and it gets a jerk, it thinks that I am in the city. You have to create a river for that. It will take up to your hands. So, the natural method is artificial? Yes, it is artificial. Srikanth has a habit of leaving a lot of water. Okay. You have to give water to Srikanth. Because there is oil in it. If you leave water, it will absorb the water. There is no oil in it. Okay. So, from the initial stage, you have to give water to Srikanth. After 7 to 8 years, you have to completely remove the water. You have to remove all the water. You have to remove as much water as you can. Then, you have to keep Srikanth as a bed. That is the price of the bed. Then, the next thing is, The other thing is, If you don't have a bed and bed, you have to use a bucket to drink. Especially in rainy season. If you have a bucket on rainy season, the excess water will reduce the bucket. Okay. Then, it will take up so much of your time. If you clean it, the bucket will move to the other side. Yes, yes. There are big holes in the other side. If you let the water to drain, you won't get any oil. The water is only 1 inch deep. We don't have water. We have to dig 8000 feet deep for 1 inch of water. How? We have to dig deep and then eat. Because it will become mulching. And then the subtle beings will get tired and become humorous. Because it is not possible to get the nutrients from the earth. The reason I am telling you to do this work is because you don't need to do smart work or hard work. You don't need labour, you don't need oil, you don't need water.

No sir, not at the initial stage. In the initial stage, you should not do anything. After 5 years, I have been doing this for 7 years.

So, I am asking you to take the future into your hands. I am saying that from 10,000 to 16,000 kgs are taken. If our farmers get 100 kgs of rice, they will have 10 kgs of rice daily. So, I am asking you at a marginal rate. If you have 5,000 kgs, you will have it at any time. But you are not saying 16,000 kgs. Because the rice is not available. If you have 5000 kgs of rice, you will have 20 kgs of rice daily. If you have 20 kgs of rice, you will have 1 lakh per kg. You will have 300 kgs of rice daily. You have built a 3 crore house. Why are you saying this? Because at this rate, I will go to the case jail and inform the general manager, that you have taken Rs. 11,500. I am not telling you that. Because if I tell you that, you will not get it, then you will lose faith in me. If I tell you that, I will be very happy. So, I am asking you at a marginal rate. If you take 35 kgs of rice, you will take it. I am taking 20 kgs of rice. You will say, Madam, we have not gone to the house to buy rice. If you do not do anything, will you not get 10 kgs of rice daily? If you say 10 kgs of rice is Rs. 5000, will you not get Rs. 50,000 daily? If you say 300 kgs of rice is Rs. 1 crore, where do you think you will get Rs. 1 crore daily? How much? 12 to 15 years. Is it that much? Why? Because you have worked for 40 years as a farmer. You have retired and now you are earning Rs. 20 lakhs. You have done everything. You are saying that you have worked for 10 to 15 years. You are talking about the rice. Our father, mother, our grandfather, they have all been doing the same. So, I am asking you, why did you take this price? We have seen all the prices of rice. You have done the dalimbe, you have done the mosambi, you have done the maavu, you have done the gullagadi, you have done the batta, you have done the kabbu. You have seen the whole lot. So, I am asking you to take this price. Yes, if one person earns gold, you are making a profit. But, everyone earns gold. Then, what wrong work will you do? In your career, you will serve the land. You will rob someone's house. You will make a profit. No, in your career, you will think of changing the government, you will make a profit by giving the legal market. Yes. You will not do brown sugar, you will not earn. Then, why are you asking my question? Madam, I will tell you one thing. There is a contribution from you to nature. Because, all these are natural disasters. Why are you doing this? We are not here for the sake of nature. Now, it is time that you contribute to nature. What wrong work will you do? So, what wrong work did you do today? Why did you become famous today? Why did you clean the fields? Why did you become famous today? Why did you become famous today? To clean the fields. To make the fields famous today, the land is being taken away by the white earth. You have so much faith. The fields are becoming strong because you are weak. You have forgotten what power you have. This peace should not happen to anyone. Because, when did we get freedom if we were sitting like a book? We did not get freedom. We are not getting freedom. We have not got freedom. We have not got freedom. When we gathered up and made one group of people, we took freedom. Even though we were on the streets of our village. We took freedom. Today, you are doing national service to a country. Because, Karnataka is a small country. Karnataka is a small country. That revolution should happen because of you. Because of you, I am making you stronger. Because, I do not belong to any company or agency. I am not belonging to any company or franchise. I am a citizen. I am a person. I am the reason for you. If I had gone, how could you have believed me? Yes. 45 degree temperature is next to impossible but today I have proved it because today each of my trees are at the age of 7 years they have crossed the girth of 65 cm which is possible at the age of 15 years so what I am going to tell you is you have a better chance to get a land because you have made all the Malnades to do this you have made all the Malnades to do this

SandalWoodNewsStories_159.mp3:  When snow falls and forests growímell and shimi had appeared in Sree Ganda, but when we see Sri Gandha's Bhenigada, Jaligada when we see this our part is the best our part is the best Bhenigada is coming to us so well but it does not come to us so well in the Malyananda Jaligada when Jaligada comes to us it does not come to the Malyananda when Rakta Chandana comes to us it does not come to the Malyananda but Sri Gandha comes to us from there it comes to us because why Sri Gandha comes to us so well because we do not need big or big now there is another question how long does Sri Gandha have to be in the Kataavya one research says there is no linear relationship between size of the plant volume of the plant biomass of the plant do you know this there is no linear relationship between size of the plant volume of the plant biomass of the plant means you do not need this much for the Kataavya you have given the water with all your wealth you have given the coconut you have given the coconut for the whole crop in one drop, you have given the coconut during the second seedling or the complete development think about this now when there is plant growth what comes next then the plant does not have that much of this and what happens now when the plant grows if it despite the seed begins to be rotten and hard when it feels its root is not soft we need to have a good soil structure like a Ketchu, Chegu, R2D like a Gaba to get good soil structure we need to have a shortage of moisture and high temperature the soil should be low in temperature and the top should be hot then what happens is the plant is low in temperature and the top is at 38-40 degrees what should be done then? the plant is low in temperature the plant is low in temperature the top is at 38-40 degrees what does the soil do? it is used to water the leaves, fruits, and all the leaves, fruits, and all the soil is not yet solid the soil is low in temperature the top is hot then the soil is washed with a lot of mud I will show you the mud is washed the mud is washed then what is done is the inside the sap is what is done is the soil is it is sized it is sized it has a secondary metabolism it is nothing but defensive mechanism against drought it is nothing but formation of rot and accumulation of iron the soil is not solid what happens is it stops the growth it is not strong enough it does not need a seed it needs to live every living being in the soil needs to absorb it live, win, win don't be a coward every living being in the soil every creature in the soil needs to absorb it what does it do then? it needs to live what does it do then? it stops the growth So, the defensive mechanism is necessary for survival. It is called secondary metabolism. It is nothing but formation of artwood and accumulation of oil. The artwood formation is started inside. For that we have a church. Today, there is a huge amount of oil in the Jagatikamarukatti. We have to do it at that time. We, the people of Bayala, have made a mistake. They are very simple people. They have a lot of good deeds. We have a land of 4 acres. We have a lot of land. We have a lot of land. We have to utilize it. We have to utilize it. The forest that we live in today is different. We have to see this. Even the bloodshed has not been done in many places. It is happening here. If you have buried the bloodshed in a base, you don't have to do anything in the base. They will pour water to the well. They will pour water to the well. That is all. The bloodshed is worth nothing. The land is juice for required Estamos. Moreified Your offspring and loved family also live in that. There is westernization. We understand that, ...the full forgetfulness, the hurry, quadrupedness, In the 90's, when Tipu Sultan was re-elected, the Britishers took over the throne. The Britishers also had a lot of power and independence. Later, the same law was passed on. Law was passed in 2001. The government has also given NMPB, National Medicinal Plant Development Board, which is a national medical institution, which has been providing medical assistance for 24 years. For one acre, for Sri Gandhapelai. NMPB. For one acre. Because the government has given it for 24 years. That's why. NMPB. NMPB is a name you can google and find. For one acre, for 24 years. One time. One time. Sack. You can give it for 10 rupees. They will give you a sack of 300 grams. And then, if you get a sack of good quality Guna Matta, you can take it from there. Or if you get it for private use, you can take it. If you take it from me, I will give you one for 35 rupees. 300 grams. How much did it cost? 10,000 rupees. Government has given. For a sack of 20 ks. For a sack of 20 ks. For a sack of 20 ks. For a sack of 20 ks. For a sack of 20 ks. It will cost you. If you give me 10,000 rupees, and a sack of 20 ks, What will you get? I will get a sack of 12,000 rupees. We will keep it for ourselves. It will give you good treatment, and it will be enough to eat a sack of 12,000 rupees. Then, what is it? The reason is that the government's policies are very good for our country. It is not that we have not been able to come to Malayalee, but in Malayalee there is a lot of vegetative growth, there is a lot of biomass, secondary metabolism is less, there is a lot of crop, the catch is less, the crop is less in our country, the crop is less in the country of the village, the crop is more in the country of the village. So there is no linear relationship between the size of the plant and the quantity of our food. The crop is not very happy that the crop is not grown well. Yes, it is not happy. There is more material destruction and plant is abundant. There are more freestyleن It is very safe when the crop is not nicer and managed well. After şeyi, if you stop harvesting from the品 you deal for Raymond. One is safe. If it is gone... There is a good machine in Kerala, see, in a few dozens, with processing. You are right, we need there. We have to keep on figures. Beautiful and PPTUKULSdireation. One year, the rain does not fall. One year, the rain does not fall. One year, the cold does not fall. One year, it becomes very hot. It becomes very cold. On top of this, the temperature of the nature has a certain relation to it. That way, when it becomes very hot, very hot, very hot, when it becomes very cold, the plant gets stressed. the plant gets stressed. That year, the rain was very heavy. That year, the rain was very heavy. The rain was heavy, but the secondary metabolism was high. That means, the arcturid formation was increased. The year when the rain increased, the vegetative growth increased. So, in Malayalee, the arcturid formation takes time. We also say that when we go to the Malayalee part, or when we meet the people from there, it will take 20 to 25 years for you. You have not come here for a question. You have not come here for a question. You have not come here for a question. I'll tell you what your question is, and come and get it. I'll tell you what your question is, and come and get it. If you ask me, your questions will be different. They don't know what to ask, so they just ask and they answer. What we have told Malina brother is that Sree gandha is 20 to 25 years old. So we cannot tell Bisala brother. We are coming from you. Because, when we come here, we have a span of 10 years.
SandalWoodNewsStories_156.mp3:  Sir, if I write the first question as Sri Gandhada's tree, in some way, it is seen in the holistically of other trees. In what way is it so old that it is the oldest among other trees? If I have to talk about Sri Gandhada's oldest tree, it is not like a normal tree. It is a hemi-root parasite. It means that it is a plant that grows on the Parvava tree. Yes, it is a plant that grows on the Parvava tree. The special thing about this tree is that the hardwood is very fine. It develops from fine grains. The colour of Sri Gandhada is special. In the 10th to the 7th year, the hardwood develops and Sri Gandhada's oil is prepared and deposited in it. Yes. So, Sri Gandhada's quality is medicinal. Yes, it is medicinal. Because it is a good medicinal plant, it is also good for health. Yes, it is a speciality of Sri Gandhada. Sir, now that we know what the first question is, we have understood that we need to know about Sri Gandhada. Now, we have to know about the first part, the Sasi Gullu. Where did you get these Sasi Gullu? Sri Gandhada Sasi Gullu was grown in our nurseries all over the kingdom. These are the Sasi Gullu that are used for the farming of the forest. We grow these Sasi Gullu in the Sasi Palanala of the forest. This year, we have grown more than 6 lakhs of Sasi Gullu. We have grown it and we are giving it to the people. We are giving it to the farmers. Yes, we are giving it to the farmers. This year, we have grown almost all the Sasi Gullu. Almost all the Sasi Gullu is empty. We do not get it in our nurseries or Sasi Palanala. But, this year, we have given importance to this. We have given a lot of publicity. So, the demand is high. Many people are calling. There is a lot of demand. There is a lot of demand. So, I think this year, 6 lakhs of Sasi Gullu. For the next year, the number of Sasi Gullu is... More than 20 lakhs. More than 20 lakhs. More than 20 lakhs. No one will come here to see the Maranithaakasteeru. Even after saving 10 lakhs, 10 lakhs or 7 lakhs, 8 lakhs, or any amount, we deserve to see another funded model.

There is no restriction for the birth of Srikanta. There are no rules and regulations. There was no restriction at all. Srikanta was a state tree. It was the property of the government. If there was any tree in your land or in your house, it was the property of the government. But when it matured, it was still a building. Even then, it was still a building. When it matured, it was to be put in our depot, Sandalwood. We used to take it to Srikanta's house and dress it up there. We used to dress it up and put a bell on every part. After putting a bell, we would give the total value in that 90%. We used to give it earlier but now it is the same. But initially, wherever Srikanta was, it was the property of the government. Now it is completely destroyed. That is the property of the owner of the land. So, there is no doubt about it. Yes, there is no doubt about it. Everyone in our country can grow trees. Another question is from Ashok from Darwada. Hello Ashok. Hello Sir. Ask the question. Sir, we are from Darwada district. Yes, ask the question. Sir, can you grow this in one base? Can you grow this in one base or can you give some support in the beginning? It will grow well in one base. The growth of the plant is very good. In the lower part of the tree, where the moisture and sunlight is good, it will grow very well in the upper part. In one base, we have not told you to give some support. We have not told you. So, this is the... Yes. In South Karnataka, in South Karnataka, it will grow well. Wherever it is, if it is planted in a bed, it will die. In the bunds, if it is planted in a hollow bed, it will grow well. Some people are planting it in a small area. It is growing well. It is growing well. Some people are also dripping it in the soil. Some people are not doing it. It will grow well in the upper part. It can grow in the lower part also. Yes, in the northern districts also. I have seen it in Gulbarga. In the northern districts, where the main crops are irrigated, there is some moisture. It is growing well there also. Sir, one more question. How many years does it take for a plant to grow well? For a plant to grow well, as I have told you, from 7 years to 10 years, it is actually a hot wood. It has a brown colour inside. It is growing well. It is growing well. Since then, it has been growing well for a week. It is getting more and more. For 10 years, it can get 1 to 2 kg of hot wood. For 15 years, it will not stay as it is. It may be a little bit of a drop. It may be a little drop or a drop of a drop. It may be a drop of water. It is a hot wood formation. It is not getting well everywhere. It is getting very well in some places. In some places, it is medium, average. We can remember that it has grown. If it has grown there, we can put it in an auger and turn it and see how white it is. Then we can know that it is in some kind of a pot. Yes, we can remember that. For 15 years, it can grow from 4 to 5 kg to 10 kg of gold. For 20 years, it will grow more. It will grow more. It will grow more. It will grow more. It will grow more in the form of a rain. It will grow more. The hot wood is growing. The soil is growing. It is growing more. That is why the hot wood is growing inside. If you give it more water and grow it, the soil will grow more and the hot wood inside will be less. That is very important. So, we do not need a lot of water. It is good for the food. It is slow. What you said about benture. I did not know about it. In Schüler. Oh, yes in Schüler. Do you know the front? Yes teacher. Yes. I told him about the front. I told him to � ransom south or channels to님. Sir, it is easier to come. from the nearest river for constantly camping one. I told my brother, I can take it.

The sage was saying that Vana Besa can be found in many earths. He was saying that it can be found in many earths.
SandalWoodNewsStories_171.mp3:  On community language, welcome our responsible reproducer Maharaj Dev Connection by之 It has been our Dog for 6,8,10 years then carefully catch all the Batman guys then24 times check whether he is back home with the oxygen back presents for any intimart the water is full of it because when we wake up in the morning we use perfume for scent and oil what we use is chemical when oil is there chemical and pesticide it is gone it is gone music can we use organic fertilizers I have not used nitrate fixing tree I have used other ag can we use inorganic fertilizers DAP because in the first initial stage for 3-4 years when the soil is less when the berries spread and nutrients are not there the plant is suffering 50-100 grams of nutrients in a meter or 50 cm you can see the size you can make a trench and make a hole in it and water it and it will heat up the soil will heat up and the water will not flow it will not be good you can make a hole in it and then after 8-9 years the art root formation starts when the art root formation starts you have to check because people ask how do you know that the art root has not been formed normally if the sandalwood is not formed it will be a lump it will be smooth when the art root starts there will be cracks when the art root is full there will be more cracks that is the first clue that the art root has not been formed that is the first clue that is the second clue so we have to check with the help of the instrument we have a machine that is called Electrode domo we have to use that to make a small current and when we pass it moves and we have to capture it and put it in the computer and then we will know whether the art root is not damaged or not destructive after 6-8 years you have to check the art root carefully what if the art root has not formed what will you do some people say that the art root has not formed but I am not sure but generally I say this Srikanta Marana why we are in a place where the base is less or where the soil is less is because we are giving a little stress what happens when we stress when the art root starts there is a belief in the literature but we don't know what kind of stress we are giving when we are stressed the art root formation happens when the root is not there when the root is not there the art root is disturbed when the root is touched when the art root is disturbed the art root formation is affected the water is less the art root is distilled all these things induce the art root but we haven't got any correct literature proof so we have to listen to what is written usually when we write a dry letter the art root formation is not good we raise the production that is good continue maybe according to the nature of the 왜 usually if the uptick is from recommend or sometimes write about all these should be planned, how many years it will take to get the exact amount of land we should know this correctly we will take 5 to 5 distance from each other but before checking the soil report, you should decide the distance if you go to the north side, there is a coconut farm it will be planted in 5 to 10 feet from here if you go to the south side, in chikmalur you will have to take a short distance in tippur, they will not allow you to stand in front of the coconut farm if you go to chikmalur, they will not allow you to go near the trench so, in all these situations, you should order the soil from the source I am asking this in general you are asking why there is no air if you want to reduce the amount of water, if the soil is good you can do it in 4 places or you can do it in 5 and 4 places you can decide that that is the soil interest report so, what is the next?

You have the knowledge of all these. So how did you learn it? I have learnt it from my father. I learnt it because the land is not suitable for farming. We have to cut the land. Because it will not change fast. I have learnt a lot about it. I have learnt it. After learning it, I have learnt it. Because it is an attraction to camp. Because it absorbs water quickly.

SandalWoodNewsStories_172.mp3:  I have come to a farm. I will show you how many plants are planted in one acre of land and how it is cultivated. Before that, let's see the BMM Farm. This is the BMM Organic Farm. They have planted sandalwood trees in one acre of land. Let's see how it is cultivated. They have cultivated the land here. If the water level is low, the water will be drained out of the land. This will help the soil. You can see the sandalwood trees. They are so beautiful. When I say Sri Gandha, I can't help but think of the crowd. I have to tell you a speciality. This tree cannot survive on its own. If we want Sri Gandha to survive, we have to give a parallel tree to it. When there is a tree next to it, the tree will die. If you want to grow anything, it is not good to grow only Sri Gandha. You have to give a supportive host plant to it. Only then, the tree will grow well. The tree will grow well and grow up to be your Sri Gandha. There are 15 varieties of sandals in the world. In that, there are Australian sandals and sandals. Both of these are very good. In India, there are two types of sandals. One is the Indian sandal and the other is the Australian sandal. Both of these are very good. In the world, we feel that both are very good. Especially, our Indian sandals have a lot of value. So, when we think about it, how much profit will we get if we do this farming? Before 2001, what we noticed was that even if we grow our own Sri Gandha, it was the government's choice. But now, the government has to promote this. Even if you grow your own sandal privately, you can grow your own Sri Gandha. But, the government has to take care of all the other factors. So, even if you grow one sandal, it should not be registered by the government. But, the good thing is that you can grow your own Sri Gandha in your farm. If you are able to do this as your children, usually, what we say is that for 30 years, if we grow our own Sri Gandha, we will get a lot of profit. It can be a lot of money. But, if we follow the scientific methods, if we take all these, if we grow our own Sri Gandha, we will get that profit in 15 years. That is the guarantee. That is, in 30 years, in 15 years, in half a term, we will get the profit. So, now, we are seeing these sandals in this farm. These sandals have been here for almost 2 years. So, it has been 2-3 years. We can see these mixed sandals here. If you grow these sandals after 10 years of natural farming, if you grow them after watching them very well, they will make at least 3 crore rupees. At least. Because, the rates will change. But still, the wood, usually, when we cut the wood, we get soft wood. That is why, there is not much value. But, in between that, there is hard wood. This is the value. If the shape of the wood is 2 feet, that is, from 70 to 80 kg, you will get hard wood from one tree. You can count the value of that wood. How much is it? For this, it is 250 more Rs. Sir...

If you give only nutrition from the 3rd year, you will start to become a millionaire in 10 years. If you just plant Shree Gantha, it will not be possible to get rid of it. Because it can only take 2-3 nutrients from the soil. For that, another nutrient is required. You can use Dalimba, Sev, Papaya, any nutrient you want. But you need to give the support, the host plant, the regular nutrient. So, the berry of that nutrient will start to take the nutrients from this berry. By taking the nutrients, this fruit nutrient will be able to grow beautifully and beautifully. And it will be possible to grow even your Shree Gantha tree. So, this will never grow as a single tree. For that, another nutrient should be required. But we need to notice one more thing. If we are planting any regular nutrient, it should not be more than Shree Gantha. Because the sunlight is very important for that. From those sunlight, the oil and the soil should be keptторы checked heavily. Or else, you can reduce the période of time to 4 weeks. Also, if this year this year, you are growing youriritorn gaps then, You can take a good care of the growing period of time.
